# wikipedia-top-corpus
Most of the top 50,000 pages from wikipedia as plain text files

All files are extracted from wikipedia_en_top_nopic_2023-01.zim downloaded from https://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Content_in_all_languages using a modified version of [zim_to_corpus](https://github.com/DavidNemeskey/zim_to_corpus).

Some manual cleanup has been performed to remove entries with barely any content due to the absence of images, tables, citations, etc. Most flowing text has been preserved.
