# wikipedia-top-corpus
Most of the top 50,000 pages from wikipedia as plain text files

All files are extracted from wikipedia_en_top_nopic_2023-01.zim downloaded from https://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Content_in_all_languages using a modified version of [zim_to_corpus](https://github.com/DavidNemeskey/zim_to_corpus).

Some manual cleanup has been performed to remove documents with barely any content due to the absence of images, tables, citations, etc. Most flowing text has been preserved.

The result is roughly 1.13GB of plain text.
