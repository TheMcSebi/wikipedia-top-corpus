Check on It
"Check on It" is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé. It was written by her, Swizz Beatz, Sean Garrett, Angela Beyincé and Slim Thug, and produced by Swizz Beatz. Initially recorded solely by Beyoncé, the song was supposed to be featured on the soundtrack for 2006 film The Pink Panther, in which she co-starred as Xania. As it was ultimately not included on the soundtrack, the version with additional vocals from Slim Thug was placed on the 2005 Destiny's Child's greatest hits album #1's. Columbia Records released a remix version of "Check on It" featuring both Slim Thug and Bun B as the second single from #1's on December 13, 2005.


The song's development was motivated by the phrase "Check on It", which Beyoncé and her management jokingly used before they decided to turn it into a song. "Check on It" is an R&B and hip hop song, which is instrumentally complete with a heavy bassline, strings, and wind instrument. Lyrically, it takes place in a club, where Beyoncé is letting the male patrons know that they are welcome to come and look at her body when she is dancing. The song consists of two verse-raps by Slim Thug. "Check on It" was well received by contemporary music critics, who universally complimented Beyoncé's vocals, as well as her assertive delivery.
"Check on It" was not originally intended as a single from #1's. However, it received heavy rotation on US radio stations, following the release of the first single "Stand Up for Love" (2005), which failed to chart. Eventually, "Check on It" debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 in November 2005, before its official release date. The song peaked at number one for five consecutive weeks, becoming one of the two longest-running number-one singles of 2006, and Beyoncé's third US number-one single as a solo artist. Internationally, it reached number one in New Zealand and the top ten in Canada and numerous European countries.
The accompanying music video for "Check on It" was directed by Hype Williams, and premiered on December 16, 2005, on MTV.

Composition
"Check on It" is a midtempo R&B and hip hop song, which makes use of a heavy bassline, strings, wind instrument, and frequent "swinging pelvic taunts". According to the sheet music published by Sony/ATV Music Publishing at Musicnotes.com, the song is written in the key of G major and is set in common time at 166 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocal range spans from the low note A3 to the high note B4. According to Bill Lamb of About.com, Beyoncé adopts smooth and alluring vocals throughout "Check on It". Lyrically, the song takes place in a dance club, where the female protagonist is letting the male patrons know that they are welcome to come and look at her body when she is dancing. "Check on It" starts with a verse-rap from Slim Thug: "Good girls gotta get down with them gangstas / Go head girl put some back and some neck up on it..." The rapper sounds like a 1975 Mercury Cougar turning over as he growls in his burly purr, as written by Bret McCabe of Baltimore City Paper.
In the first verse, Beyoncé sings to the "sexual teasing" lyrics, which are addressed to the men looking at her: "I can be a tease, but I really wanna please you [...] Oohhh you watchin[g] me shake it,  Ya can't take it, it’s blazin[g] ...". The chorus lines; "Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight" are sung in a very quick and breathless manner by Beyoncé. Bret McCabe noted that her pace could be compared to that of R&B singer Donna Summer. Slim Thug appears again after the second verse to perform another different verse rap: "I’m checking on you boo, do what’chu do / And while you dance I’ma glance at this beautiful view / I’m keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue ’em with glue ...". Before the song ends, Beyoncé repeats the chorus lines four times as additional vocals of hers are played in the background.

James Blake of BBC Music wrote that the lyrics are pleasantly aggressive and critical of women.
Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music described "Check on It" as "sinuously brilliant". James Anthony of the British newspaper The Guardian wrote that the song "espouses a blissful disregard for traditional songwriting conventions.

In the July 2006 issued copy of Spin magazine, Nick Duerden ranked the song at the seventh place on his list of The ten Beyoncé tracks you need to download, writing that "Check on It" is Beyoncé's sexiest song to date.

In the video, Beyoncé is seen mostly in all pink, and the dancers wear PVC jackets and dance around rippling satin sheets. She occasionally bends over and grabs her behind.

Where black bars normally appear on a 4:3 (full screen) television showing a widescreen production, footage is displayed of curtains moving in the background.
