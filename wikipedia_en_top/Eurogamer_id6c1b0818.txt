Eurogamer
Eurogamer is a British video game journalism website launched in 1999 and owned by alongside formed company Gamer Network. Its editor-in-chief is Martin Robinson.


Since 2008, it is known for the formerly eponymous games trade fair EGX organised by its parent company, which was called Eurogamer Expo until 2013. From 2013 to 2020, sister site USGamer ran independently under its parent company.
History
Eurogamer (initially stylised as EuroGamer) was launched on 4 September 1999 under company Eurogamer Network. The founding team included John "Gestalt" Bye, the webmaster for the PlanetQuake website and a writer for British magazine PC Gaming World; Patrick "Ghandi" Stokes, a contributor for the website Warzone; and Rupert "rauper" Loman, who had organised the EuroQuake esports event for the game Quake.
Eurogamer hosts content from media outlet Digital Foundry since 2007, which was founded by Richard Leadbetter in 2004. In January 2008, Tom Bramwell overtook the role of editor-in-chief from Kristan Reed, remaining in that role until he resigned in November 2014. Afterwards Oli Welsh served as editor for Eurogamer.
In February 2015, Eurogamer dropped its ten-point scale for review scores instead highlight some games the reviewer felt particularly strongly with labels such as 'Essential', 'Recommended' or 'Avoid'. The change was driven by doubt about the score system's usefulness and its desire to be delisted from review aggregator Metacritic because of its "unhealthy influence" on the games industry. In 2021, the community forum for Eurogamer closed, with the site recommending other platforms such as Discord instead.
Regional websites
Eurogamer has several regional sub-outlets, with some franchised publications:
