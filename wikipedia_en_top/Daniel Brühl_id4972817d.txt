Early life
Daniel César Martín Brühl González was born on 16 June 1978 in Barcelona. His father was the German TV director and documentalist Hanno Brühl, who was born in São Paulo, Brazil. His mother is Marisa González Domingo, a Spanish teacher. He was born in Spain because his mother did not trust German doctors. Shortly after his birth, the family moved to Cologne, Germany, where he grew up. He has a brother, Oliver, and a sister, Miriam. They were raised speaking Spanish, German, Catalan, and French. He attended secondary school at the Dreikönigsgymnasium, the oldest school in Cologne.
Career
1995–2002: Early work
Brühl began acting at a young age despite not having any formal training as an actor. He participated in children's theater at school and first earned money at age 8 doing radio plays, followed by work in a dubbing studio leading to one of the dubbing actors to recommend the teenager to a talent agency. At age 15, Brühl landed a small part in the TV film Svens Geheimnis, played the street kid Benji in the soap opera Verbotene Liebe (Forbidden Love)(1995), and continued to feature in television series in the following years. In 1999, he appeared in his film debut as Checo in Paradise Mall (Schlaraffenland) and voiced Kom in the German version of Le château des singes. In 2000, he starred in his first main role as Markus Baasweiler in No More School (Schule) and was cast as Jay in Deeply.
In 2001, he continued to play main roles as the schizophrenic Lukas in Hans Weingartner's critically acclaimed debut film Das Weisse Rauschen (The White Sound), as Daniel in Nichts Bereuen (No Regrets), and as Marek in Honolulu.

He won the German Film Critics Award (2003) for Best Actor for Das Weisse Rauschen and Vaya con Dios. For Das Weisse Rauschen, Brühl insisted on meeting someone with paranoid schizophrenia to avoid the risk of making the character look clichéd. Two decades later, he still considers it his most difficult character to portray and comments that "It was important for me to explore my own madness, to believe in what I was doing and to convince myself that I was suffering from that disease, so it was quite difficult." The film has been widely cited by the academic community in discussing and understanding schizophrenia due to its realistic portrayal.

He had to endure seven hours of prosthetics daily during taping as his face structure was altered to take on Lauda's features. Brühl added layers that are different from Lauda to find the right balance of not just imitating the person, but also being creative. The film was a commercial and critical success. For his authentic portrayal of Lauda in terms of accent and mannerisms, he received multiple award nominations including the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor, the Critic's Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor, the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actor and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.

Reception and acting style
— Peter Morgan on Brühl
The roles Brühl takes on are often morally complex characters, men who are suffering with a deep-seated darkness that threatens to weigh down their inherent humanity. He has utilized method acting since the beginning of his career. A German and Spanish national, he has played at least nine different nationalities (Polish, Spanish, French, Hungarian, German, Austrian, British, American, and a fictional Sokovian) and in his films has spoken English, Spanish, German, French, Polish, and Chinese (comfortably in the first four mentioned). Writing for The Hollywood Reporter in 2018, Katie Kilkenny said: "If Hollywood executives have a global, and particularly European, male part to cast, there's a good chance Bruhl will make the shortlist. How did Bruhl become Hollywood's answer to a global everyman? The answer, collaborators say, lies not only in Bruhl's multilingualism, but also his choice of collaborators and Hollywood's welcoming of an influx of German talent in the last two decades." In a 2017 interview with Gentleman's Journal, Brühl attributed his success to finding his niche as an actor.
On being typecast as a villain after taking on an increasing number of antagonistic roles, Brühl said that though it was a privilege to have made Good Bye, Lenin!, it was also a "curse" because he "was always offered the part of the sympathetic nice guy" and was refreshed and relieved when offered villain roles outside of Germany. The Hollywood Insider noted his atypical career arc, "He went from consistently playing the love interest in European Cinema to playing the villain in Hollywood". Baron Zemo became one of the most iconic villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe despite having no superpowers because of Brühl's performance. Film School Rejects remarks, "Even when embodying the role of a Nazi or another nefarious villain, Brühl manages to bring out the character's humanity — no matter how little of it there actually is". Brühl has also been described as having an "innate likability and charm". The LA Times deemed his openness as such that "even his irony sounds straightforward". He has also been lauded for his work ethic. He befriended activist Daniel Domscheit-Berg and racing driver Niki Lauda after meeting them in preparation for his roles.
Public image
Brühl is referred to as the "golden boy of German film" and the "undisputed ruler of the European acting elite" by The Gentleman's Journal on its May/June 2017 cover. He is also regarded as the most recognizable German actor to emerge since the country's reunification. He graced the GQ Germany cover issue in December 2015 and was the recipient of the GQ Film National Award at the 2015 GQ Men of the Year Awards. He also headlined Esquire Spain, Esquire Germany, and Men's Health Best Fashion magazine, and featured in Esquire UK. He shot a Vogue and GQ Germany advert with his wife too. He became a CUPRA ambassador in December 2020, launching the CUPRA Leon e-HYBRID as the brand's first plug-in hybrid model. In May 2021, he introduced its first 100% electric model— the CUPRA Born.
In February 2017, he was honoured by the French government at the Berlin International Film Festival and awarded the Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his 'major contribution to the influence of film culture in France, Germany, Europe and the world', making him a Knight of the Order of Arts and Literature. He was offered membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in June 2017 to vote for the Oscars. In October 2018, Brühl accompanied Germany's Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender during their visit to Spain.
Personal life
In 2006, Brühl separated from his longtime girlfriend and later fiancée, actress Jessica Schwarz, whom he had met on the set of the 2001 film No Regrets. Since 2010, he has been in a relationship with practising psychotherapist, academician, and former model and Broadway actress Felicitas Rombold. Their first son was born in October 2016, and they married sometime between the child's birth and early 2018. The couple had a second son in 2020.
His hobbies include running and hiking, and he likes playing and watching tennis, citing Rafael Nadal (who is left-handed like him) as his favourite player. He uses the sauna in his Berlin apartment, almost every day, to get into a meditative state.
Philanthropy
Since 2017, Brühl has been campaigning for the United Nations World Food Programme, the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize winner. In 2019, he supported the "Do something for Europe!" initiative to foster solidarity in Europe and The Global Fund's Step Up The Fight initiative to end AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. In the same year, he campaigned for Earth Alliance's emergency Amazon Forest Fund to support partners working on the ground to protect the Amazon. In 2020, he was one of the 25 personalities to donate a personal item for the Los Fuer Lesbos (Win for Lesvos) Leave No One Behind campaign in support of refugees, donating his antique walking stick from the set of The Alienist.
Writing
Brühl's book Ein Tag in Barcelona (Ullstein Verlag) follows him on a one-day journey through Barcelona. His book Tapas!, co-authored with Atilano González, recreates the best dishes served at the Bar Raval in Berlin.
Other ventures
Since 2011, Brühl has been the joint operator of a tapas bar named Bar Raval, located in the Kreuzberg district of Berlin. It opened during the first weekend of the 2011 Berlinale. From February to October 2017, he was joint operator of a similar bar in Prenzlauer Berg named Bar Gracia after Barcelona's nightlife district Gràcia, which closed due to lack of financial success.
