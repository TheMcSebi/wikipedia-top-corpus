Classification of inhabited localities in Russia
The classification system of inhabited localities in Russia and some other post-Soviet states has certain peculiarities compared with those in other countries.
Classes
During the Soviet time, each of the republics of the Soviet Union, including the Russian SFSR, had its own legislative documents dealing with classification of inhabited localities.  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the task of developing and maintaining such classification in Russia was delegated to the federal subjects.
