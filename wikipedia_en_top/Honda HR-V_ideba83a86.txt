Honda HR-V
The Honda HR-V is a subcompact crossover SUV (B-segment) manufactured and marketed by Honda over three generations.
The first generation HR-V was based on the Honda Logo. It was marketed from 1999 to 2006 in Europe, Japan and select Asia-Pacific markets – and featured three doors (1999–2003) or five doors (1999–2006). The two configurations were internally designated GH2 and GH4 respectively.
After a hiatus between 2006 and 2013, Honda reintroduced the nameplate for the second generation HR-V, based on the third-generation Honda Fit. Production began in late 2013 for the Japanese domestic market as the Honda Vezel (Japanese: ホンダ・ヴェゼル, Hepburn: Honda Vezeru), while production started in 2015 for North America, Australia, Brazil and select Asian markets as the HR-V. Apart from Japan, the model is also sold as the Vezel in China.
For the third-generation model, the nameplate is split between two different vehicles, one for the global market (sold as the Vezel in Japan), and a larger model based on the eleventh-generation Civic destined for North America and China. The latter will also be sold in other markets as the Honda ZR-V.
According to Honda, the name "HR-V" stands for "Hi-rider Revolutionary Vehicle", while the name "Vezel" is coined from "bezel", the oblique faces of a cut gem, with the "V" for "vehicle".
First generation (GH; 1998)
The HR-V debuted as the J-WJ concept, one of the four concepts in Honda's J-Mover Series unveiled at the 1997 Tokyo Motor Show and the 1998 Geneva Motor Show. With minimal changes from the concept, the HR-V was marketed exclusively in Japan via Honda's Verno dealership network, aimed at a young demographic. The HR-V was subsequently marketed in Europe with either a Honda D16W1 type 1.6-litre SOHC (FWD or 4WD) or a SOHC VTEC Honda D16W5 type engine (exclusively 4WD). A continuously variable transmission was optional.
The HR-V shared its platform with the Honda Logo, and was manufactured in Suzuka, Japan.  The all-wheel drive configuration was initially available in a three-door body in February 1999 and was internally designated the GH2. In September 1999, Honda introduced a front-wheel drive, three door variant. Five door models were designated GH4 and were introduced in March 2000. At this time, Honda offered a 123 bhp (125 PS; 92 kW) VTEC engine option for both the three and five-door four-wheel drive models. Neither a five-door front-wheel drive, or a front-wheel drive model with the VTEC engine were marketed.
The five-door was 110 mm longer overall, with a 100 mm longer wheelbase (2,460 mm). Suspension on all models was via MacPherson strut front suspension and a five-link De Dion-type rear suspension.
In advance of European pedestrian protection legislation, the HR-V was designed to minimize pedestrian injuries in the event of an impact.  Equipment featured ABS brakes with EBD (electronic brakeforce distribution), dual SRS (supplemental restraint system) airbags, as well as folding power mirrors, power windows, folding rear seats, power steering, heat absorbing glazing, air conditioning, front fog lights and a rear spoiler with an LED center high-mounted brake light. A 285-litre cargo area was equipped with cargo hooks, a subdivided underfloor compartment, and 50:50 split-fold rear seats. Options included body colour roof rails and a large rear roof spoiler.
The Real Time 4WD system, shared with the CR-V, uses a dual hydraulic pump rear differential where the 4WD system is hydraulically activated when the front wheels lose traction. The HR-V was noted for its low nitrous oxide emissions.
The HR-V received an exterior and interior facelift for model year 2002.
Second generation (RU; 2013)
The second generation HR-V was previewed as the Urban SUV Concept which was unveiled at the 2013 North American International Auto Show. The concept version was said to be based on Honda's Global Compact Series, which includes the Honda Fit subcompact and the Honda City subcompact sedan.
The vehicle was unveiled in November 2013 at the Tokyo Motor Show as the Vezel. Based on the Honda Fit platform, at the time of its introduction it was the smallest SUV from Honda, below the CR-V.  The exterior design of the crossover is inspired by coupés with its sloping roof, and a unique design element like hidden rear door handles.
In terms of practicality, at its release in Europe, Honda claimed the HR-V offers 453 L (16.0 cu ft) of boot space with the rear seats up and 1,026 L (36.2 cu ft) with the rear seats down. While in the North America, the HR-V is said to have 24.3 cu ft (690 L) with the rear seats up, and 58.8 cu ft (1,670 L) with the rear seats folded. Honda has described its cabin as “exceptionally versatile,” due to the inclusion the Magic Seats system carried over from the Fit which enables the lower part of the rear seat to be folded up to carry tall items.
The HR-V's body uses 27% ultra-high-strength steel grades, of either of 780, 980 or 1,500 MPa yield strength.
Japan
The Japanese Vezel models went on sale on 20 December 2013. The Vezel was available with two powertrains, as a conventional gasoline-powered and as hybrid electric vehicle. In Japan, the hybrid version was expected to account for 90 percent of the Vezel sales. Its width dimension exceeds Japanese government dimension regulations (1,700 mm) which means Japanese buyers are liable for extra yearly taxes as a result.
The conventional Vezel is equipped with a 1.5-litre direct-injection DOHC i-VTEC inline-four engine coupled to a continuously variable transmission (CVT7), and it is available in front-wheel and all-wheel drive versions.
The Vezel hybrid version is equipped with Honda's next-generation sport hybrid i-DCD system that combines a 96 kW (131 PS), 156 N⋅m (115 lb⋅ft) 1.5-litre direct injection engine with a 22 kW (30 PS), 160 N⋅m (118 lb⋅ft) electric motor, Honda's Real Time AWD, Reactive Force Pedal. The hybrid version fuel economy is 27.0 km/L (76.3 mpg‑imp; 63.5 mpg‑US) (3.7 L/100 km) in the Japanese JC08 cycle, while the gasoline version has a fuel economy of 20.6 km/L (58.2 mpg‑imp; 48.5 mpg‑US) (4.9 L/100 km) in the JC08 cycle.
The facelifted model was unveiled on 25 January 2018 in Japan and released later on 15 February 2018. It features a revised chrome bar grille and LED headlamps both being similar to Honda Civic, thin chrome garnish strip on the rear trunk and updated front bumper.
North America
The second-generation Honda HR-V debuted at the 2014 New York International Auto Show as a concept car, with the production model unveiled later at the 2014 LA Auto Show. The HR-V was introduced in the United States in 2015 as a 2016 model. It shares the same platform as the third-generation Fit and is largely identical to the Vezel, which went on sale in Japan in December 2013. The HR-V is smaller than both CR-V and Pilot, again (after the demise of Element) giving Honda a model range with three crossover SUVs.
The US-market HR-V is manufactured at Honda's Celaya, Mexico assembly plant alongside the related Fit and went on sale in May 2015 as a 2016 model. It is powered by a 1.8-litre SOHC i-VTEC I4 engine mated either to a CVT7 transmission similar to the Civic or a 6-speed manual transmission (FWD only).
For the 2019 model year, Honda announced the mid-cycle refresh for the HR-V. It features a revised chrome bar grille being similar to Honda Civic and new headlamp design featuring a single projector lens with DRLs or full LED headlamp similar to the Civic Touring, updated bumper design and overhead roof rails. There are now two headlight options as well; full LED headlights for the touring trim, or LED projector headlights for the other trims. On the interior, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto has been made available. The head unit is now updated and features a volume knob replacing the volume slider. Honda Sensing is standard on EX trims and higher. Although the manual transmission is no longer available, Honda tweaked the CVT7 transmission as well as the optional AWD system. Two new trim levels for the HR-V, Sport and Touring, were added to the trim lineup, now ranging from LX, Sport, EX, EX-L, and Touring.
China
In China, the vehicle is manufactured and marketed by two separate joint ventures with different names and cosmetic changes. Guangqi Honda revealed the vehicle with the Vezel nameplate in October 2014. It is mostly identical with the global model. Inside, the dual-tone interior features black and orange finish instead of a full grey theme.
In November 2014, Dongfeng Honda released its own version called the Honda XR-V. Previewed by the XR-V Concept in September 2014, it features a redesigned front and rear fascia and door panel sheet metals as it is positioned as a more aggressive looking vehicle. In the rear end, the taillights have been replaced with narrower, LED lights that span the entire width of the rear end. The interior is slightly different from the Vezel with the horizontal HVAC vents replaced by round vents. Both the Vezel and XR-V are powered with a 1.5-litre or 1.8-litre i-VTEC petrol engines.
Honda revealed the facelifted XR-V in February 2020 featuring an updated front fascia and rear bumper. The engine options of the facelift model includes a 1.5-litre VTEC Turbo engine and a 1.5-litre i-VTEC naturally aspirated engine.
Electric versions
The first battery electric version of the Honda Vezel was marketed by Guangqi Honda as the Everus VE-1 in China, based on the Everus EV concept. The production model debuted in November 2019. The electric version of the Honda XR-V was marketed by Dongfeng Honda as the Ciimo XN-V, based on the XN-V Concept. Production began in October 2019. Another electric version released by Dongfeng Honda is the Ciimo M-NV which was revealed in November 2020 which sports a new front and rear fascia design, and a completely redesigned interior with a 12.3-inch TFT instrument cluster and push-button gear selector.

The HR-V was launched in Malaysia in February 2015 as a locally assembled model with three trim levels: S, E and V. All variants were updated in May 2016 where the previously offered 16 inch alloy wheels were swapped for 17 inch. A limited 'Mugen' edition based on the V trim was launched in February 2018 and was limited to 1,020 units. Bookings open for the facelift version in July 2018 and in November 2018, a facelift HR-V was showcased during the 2018 Kuala Lumpur International Motor Show. In January 2019, the facelifted HR-V was launched with four trims: 1.8 E, 1.8 V, 1.8 RS and Sport Hybrid i-DCD. Malaysia became the only country outside of Japan to officially market the Vezel/HR-V hybrid. It was reported that 3,000 facelifted HR-V units was delivered with a total of 8,500 bookings. Fast forward to August 2021, Honda Malaysia announced prices for the updated HR-V Hybrid. Coming in at RM114k, it gets an updated kit list that's similar to the 1.8V model.

Taiwan
The HR-V was introduced in Taiwan in October 2016 and is only available with the 1.8-litre engine. It comes in three different trims, the VTi, VTi-S and S. All models feature a CVT transmission, with the VTi featuring seven gear ratios (including L), whereas the VTi-S and S have five gear ratios. For the 2019 refresh, the VTi model was discontinued. The refresh also brought the CVT gearbox to the VTi-S model, as well as several other minor tweaks, like 17-inch alloy wheels (up from 16-inch). The S trim was updated with full LED lights, an updated entertainment system with improved reversing camera and a few other minor tweaks.
Brazil
The Brazil-market HR-V, assembled locally at Honda's plant in the state of São Paulo and also imported from Argentina, went on sale in first-quarter 2015 as a 2016 model. For the first nine months of 2015, Honda's production in Brazil was reported to increase by 20 percent as a result of the launch of HR-V compared with a 20% drop for the industry.
On 21 May 2020, the last HR-V rolled out the assembly line of the Argentinian plant, marking the closure of the plant. This means Brazil is the only producer of the HR-V in South America.
Others
The HR-V was launched in Pakistan in 2016 but was later discontinued owing to poor sales. Despite being a global model, Honda did not market the second-generation HR-V in India where it has significant operations, citing uncompetitive pricing compared to its rivals and potentially high investment for the localization of components. A Honda executive cited an example of the crossover's electric parking brake which comes standard with the vehicle that would inflate the cost, while the vehicle was not designed with a manual handbrake in mind. Honda offered the cheaper Brio-based BR-V and the Fit/Jazz-based WR-V instead. The company has started a project from late 2017 to produce and market the second-generation HR-V in India from December 2019, only to be shelved again due to low sales forecast.
Safety
Recall
Vezel Hybrid produced in Japan from July 2013 through February 2014 were recalled due to a problem with the software program controlling the 7-speed dual clutch transmission (DCT) which could cause a delay in the ability to begin driving or the inability to move at all.
Honda recalled 160,000 Fit subcompact and Vezel sport-utility vehicles, manufactured from August 2013 through February 2016 in Japan, because of defective power steering and a part that controls the electric current in the vehicles. The recall does not affect any Honda models sold abroad.
Third generation
The third-generation HR-V is split into two different models for different markets. The global model (with "RV" model code) was first introduced in 2021 and has been produced in Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil, Taiwan, China and Pakistan while also marketed in Europe. The North American market received a different and larger model (with "RZ" model code) which is claimed to "meet the distinct needs of U.S. customers", and will be sold outside North America as the Honda ZR-V.
