Missouri Senate
The Missouri Senate is the upper chamber of the Missouri General Assembly. It has 34 members, representing districts with an average population of 174,000. Its members serve four-year terms, with half the seats being up for election every two years. The Senate chooses a President Pro Tempore to serve in the absence of the lieutenant governor or when he shall have to exercise the office of governor of Missouri if there is a vacancy in that office due to death, resignation, impeachment, or incapacitation.
Members of the Missouri General Assembly are prohibited from serving more than eight years in either the state house of representatives or state senate, or a total of sixteen years, due to statutory term limits.
