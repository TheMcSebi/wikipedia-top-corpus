Controversies
On 14 February 2006, US law firm Lieff Cabraser filed a nationwide class action lawsuit against Tata. In July 2013, judge Claudia Wilken of the US District Court, Northern District of California in Oakland, California, granted final approval to the settlement of the lawsuit on behalf of all non-US citizens employed by TCS within the state of California from 14 February 2002 to 30 June 2005. The workers claimed that they were forced to sign over their federal and state tax refunds to their employer, as well as stating their Indian salaries were wrongfully deducted from their US pay.
On 22 February 2013, the company agreed to settle for a sum of ₹1.62 billion (equivalent to ₹2.3 billion or US$29 million in 2020), this class-action suit filed in a United States court on payment to employees on deputation.
A US grand jury has slapped two companies of India's Tata Group – Tata Consultancy Services and Tata America International Corp – with a US$940 million fine in a trade secret lawsuit filed against them. Epic Systems had accused TCS and Tata America International Corp, in a lawsuit filed in October 2014 in US District Court in Madison, which was amended in January and December 2015, of "brazenly stealing the trade secrets, confidential information, documents and data" belonging to Epic.  This Epic Systems lawsuit against TCS was closed and settled with an undisclosed out-of-court agreement that was completed in January 2018.
A federal class-action lawsuit accusing Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. of bias against US-born workers was heard by the court during a jury trial in November 2018.  The US federal court Case in Northern District of California (Buchanan v. Tata Consultancy Servs., Ltd., 4:15-cv-01696) is one of seven asserting that several large offshore and national IT staffing companies with operations in the US prefer foreign workers from South Asia over qualified Americans. All the companies being sued are heavy users of H-1B guestworker visas, which go to skilled professionals in "specialty occupations".  The US Federal District Court Case 15-cv-01696-YGR consolidated these lawsuits against TCS and several other IT staffing companies into a class action trial and was allowed by the Federal District Court to proceed (but not yet certified) with a November 2018 jury trial.
In May 2013, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), in its extensive coverage of the hiring of temporary foreign workers in Canada and the unemployment issues faced by Canadians, reported that TCS rarely hires skilled experienced Canadians at the Toronto offices while advertising open positions in Canada. TCS responded that the company hired more than 125 Canadian workers in 2013 who make less than 1.2% of the 10,452 workers the company has outside of India.
In April 2015, a class-action lawsuit against TCS was filed in a San Francisco federal court by a US information technology worker and ex-employee, who accused the company of discriminating against American workers by favouring South Asians in hiring and promotion. The lawsuit claimed that South Asians comprise 95% of the company's 14,000-person US workforce and that TCS engaged in discriminatory practices by sourcing most of its workforce through the H-1B visa programme, by focusing its US-based hiring disproportionately on South Asians, and by favouring South Asian employees in its human resources practices. In response, TCS refuted the plaintiff's claims, assuring that it is an equal opportunity employer and bases its employment practices on non-discriminatory reasons. A spokesperson said that in 2014 alone the company had recruited over 2,600 US hires.
That same month, electric utility Southern California Edison (SCE) laid off about 400 IT employees, with an additional 100 IT workers leaving voluntarily. Meanwhile, the utility company hired  immigrants from TCS and competing company Infosys. In October 2015, the United States Department of Labor concluded Infosys did not abuse the H1-B programme in the dealings with SCE, while TCS's case remained open.
