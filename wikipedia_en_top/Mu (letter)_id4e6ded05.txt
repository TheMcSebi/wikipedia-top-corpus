Mu (letter)
Mu /Ààm(j)uÀê/ (uppercase Œú, lowercase Œº; Ancient Greek Œº·ø¶ [m≈∑Àê], Greek: ŒºŒπ or ŒºœÖ‚Äîboth [mi]) is the 12th letter of the Greek alphabet, representing the voiced bilabial nasal IPA: [m]. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 40. Mu was derived from the Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol for water, which had been simplified by the Phoenicians and named after their word for water, to become ê§åimg (mem). Letters that derive from mu include the Roman M and the Cyrillic –ú.
