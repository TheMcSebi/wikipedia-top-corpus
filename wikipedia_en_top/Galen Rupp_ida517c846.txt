Galen Rupp
Galen Rupp (born May 8, 1986) is an American long-distance runner. He competed in the Summer Olympics in 2008 in Beijing, 2012 in London, 2016 in Rio de Janeiro and 2021 in Tokyo. He won the silver medal in the men's 10,000-meter run in London and the bronze medal in the men's marathon in Rio de Janeiro. Rupp competed for the University of Oregon and trained under Alberto Salazar as a member of the Nike Oregon Project. He won the 2017 Chicago Marathon, becoming the first American to do so since Khalid Khannouchi in 2002. Rupp won marathon at the United States Olympic Trials in Atlanta on February 29, 2020, with a time of 2:09:20, and qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, where he took eighth place.
Rupp currently holds multiple U.S. records at the high school, collegiate and senior levels. They include records in the indoor two-mile run and 3,000-meter run with times of 8:07.41 and 7:30.16, respectively. He is considered to be one of the greatest American distance runners of all time.
Early career (2002–2004)
Born in Portland, Oregon, into a Catholic family of German descent, Rupp set junior and American high school records while competing for Portland, Oregon's Central Catholic High School. Originally a soccer player, he caught the eye of American marathon legend Alberto Salazar, who coached him to great high school success, including two Oregon state titles in cross country (2002 and 2003) and three individual championships in track and field (the 1,500-meter run in 2004 and the 3,000-meter run in 2003 and 2004). After winning the Oregon state title in cross country in 2003, he went on to finish second nationally in the 2003 Foot Locker Cross Country Championships. In the spring of 2004, Rupp won his 5,000-meter run heat against college runners at the Stanford Cardinal Invitational with a time of 13:55.32, fourth-best in U.S. prep history. He went on to break the Oregon state records for the 1,500-meter run (3:45.3) and the mile (4:01.8), the latter mark being the ninth-best in American high school history at the time.
In June 2004, Rupp broke the U.S. high school record for the 3,000-meter run with a time of 8:03.67 (since broken by German Fernandez), also breaking the high school record for the 2,000-meter run en route (5:18.5). On July 31 in Heusden-Zolder, Belgium, he broke Gerry Lindgren's 40-year-old U.S. high school record for the 5,000-meter run by almost seven seconds, with a time of 13:37.91 for the event. He finished his high school career with a 10,000-meter race in 29:09.56 in Brasschaat, Belgium, which was the fourth-fastest ever for an American high schooler. He was the Track and Field News "High School Athlete of the Year" in 2004.
Rupp delayed entering college, instead continuing to train and compete while coached by Salazar. He won the USA Junior Cross Country title in mid-February 2005 then placed 20th at the 2005 World Junior Cross Country Championships in France in mid-March. He then enrolled at the University of Oregon in time for the outdoor track season.
Collegiate career (2005–2009)
On May 7, 2005, at the Oregon Twilight Meet, Rupp broke Rudy Chapa's U.S. junior (age 19 and under) record for the 10,000-meter run with a time of 28:25.52, which is still the current North American and Pan American junior record. Two months later, he placed second in the same event at the NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship. On July 17, 2005, Rupp broke Gerry Lindgren's U.S. junior record for the 3,000-meter run in Lignano, Italy, with a time of 7:49.16, which is also the current North American and Pan American junior record.
After he led the team in the Willamette Invitational (sixth) and Pre-NCAA Invitational (12th), an injury brought Rupp's 2005 cross country season to an early end.
In indoor track, Rupp placed fifth in the 5,000-meter run and sixth in the 3,000-meter run at the 2006 NCAA indoor championships, earning All-American status in both events. His 2006 outdoor season was brief due to the onset of hypothyroidism.
Rupp returned to cross country in 2006 to defeat two-time Pac-10 champion Robert Cheseret, Bernard Lagat's brother, of the University of Arizona to become Oregon's 10th male runner to win a Pac-10 Conference cross country title. He also led a young Oregon team to victory over the Stanford Cardinal, who had won the previous six Pac-10 titles. Rupp went on to finish sixth in the 2006 NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship.
The following March, Rupp capped his indoor season by placing third in the 5,000-meter run and fourth in the 3,000-meter run at the 2007 NCAA Men's Indoor Track and Field Championship. He began his outdoor season by running a 28:35 in the 10,000-meter run at Stanford. During the race, he caused some controversy by frequently slowing down to wait for another athlete. On April 20, 2007, Rupp made a huge comeback in the last 200 meters of a 5,000-meter run race to edge out Chris Solinsky, improving his personal best to 13:30. On April 29, 2007, Rupp defeated a stellar field to win the men's 10,000-meter run at the Payton Jordan Cardinal Invitational at Stanford. Rupp's time of 27:33.48 set an American-born NCAA Collegiate Record for the event and also gave him the seventh-fastest time in U.S. history. Two weeks later, Rupp won the 10,000-meter run and 5000-meter run at the Pac-10 conference meet and helped Oregon to the team title. As in his freshman year, he went on to finish second in the 10,000-meter run at the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships.
Rupp made his global senior debut at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics and came in 11th in the 10,000-meter run.
A few months later, Rupp finished second – one second behind the winner, Liberty University's Josh McDougal – and led the Oregon Ducks to the 2007 NCAA men's cross country team championship.
Rupp redshirted the 2008 college track season to focus on the 10,000-meter run at the 2008 U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials, where he finished second (27:43.11), earning a spot on the 2008 U.S. Olympic team. He went on to finish 13th at the 2008 Olympics with an U.S. Olympic–record time of 27:36.99.
Recovering from the Olympics, Rupp avoided the early 2008 cross country season, running his first race at the Pac-10 Conference Championships, which he won in a course-record 22:55 in the 8,000 meter run. He then repeated as NCAA West Regional champion by running 27:41.24 to win the 10,000-meter run. In the 2008 NCAA national cross country championships, Rupp won his first individual NCAA title by out-kicking Liberty University's Sam Chelanga in a time of 29:03.8, a new course record on the Terre Haute, Indiana, site, and leading the Ducks to repeat as NCAA team champions.
Rupp's 2009 track season was a resounding success. Indoors, he joined the sub-4:00 club for the one-mile run on March 7 with a time of 3:57.86 at the Husky Last Chance Qualifier Meet in Seattle. On February 13, 2009, he broke the U.S. indoor 5,000-meter run record with a time of 13:18.12 at the Tyson Invitational in Fayetteville, Arkansas. At the NCAA indoor nationals, he won an unprecedented three events: the 5,000-meter run (13:41.45), the distance medley relay (running a 3:57.07 as the 1,600-meter run anchor leg only 90 minutes after his 5,000-meter run victory), and the 3000-meter run (7:48.94) the next day. This triple victory helped Oregon win its first-ever indoor national team title.
Outdoors, Rupp helped break the NCAA 4 x mile record on May 10. He ran a time of 3:58.93 as the anchor the relay, which also included his Oregon teammates Matthew Centrowitz Jr. (3:59.53), Andrew Wheating (3:59.60) and Shadrack Kiptoo-Biwott (4:05.21), and they shaved a little more than one second off the old record with their time of 16:03.24. After helping Oregon defend its Pac-10 title, Rupp won the 5,000- and 10,000-meter runs at the 2009 NCAA Division I outdoor track championships. In all, Rupp earned 14 All-American honors at Oregon, along with five individual championships, a relay championship, two NCAA cross country team titles and an indoor track NCAA team title.
In his last appearance for the University of Oregon, Rupp won the 10,000-meter run at the 2009 USA Outdoor Track & Field Championships at Hayward Field with a time of 27:52.53.
In 2009 Rupp won the inaugural Bowerman Award, which is given to college track's Athlete of the Year.
Professional career
2009–2010
Having earned himself a place on the U.S. team for the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, Rupp announced that he was turning pro and that Michael Johnson would be his agent. At the World Championships, Rupp placed eighth in the 10,000- meter run, in which he was one of only two non-Africans in the top 12 alongside Dathan Ritzenhein.
He then qualified for and competed at the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships, where he set a personal best of 7:42.40 for the 3,000-meter run, taking fifth place in the final.
Rupp knocked more than 20 seconds off his previous 10,000-meter run personal best with a time of 27:10.74 in Palo Alto, California, at the Payton Jordan Stanford Invitational. Before that race, the U.S. 10,000-meter run record was 27:13.98 by Meb Keflezighi, and though Rupp's time was over three seconds faster, he was beaten to the punch by Chris Solinsky, who won the race with a new U.S. record of 26:59.60. Two months later, Rupp retained his national title in the 10,000-meter run with a win at the 2010 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. Rupp competed on the 2010 IAAF Diamond League circuit and made a series of improvements to his personal records: He broke four minutes for the one-mile run at the Pre Classic, running it in 3:57.72, set a outdoor 3,000-meter run personal best of 7:43.24 at the London Grand Prix, and then improved his 5,000-meter run time to 13:07.35 at the season-ending Weltklasse Zürich meeting.
2011
Rupp took part in the Great Edinburgh Cross Country in 2011 and finished second behind Mo Farah, helping the U.S. team to second place. He then took part in the New York City Half Marathon, his debut at that distance and finished third in a time of 1:00:30, at the time making him the third-fastest American at the distance. At the 2011 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, he once again retained his national 10,000-meter run title, running the last 800 meters in a quick 1:52.59 to seal his victory, and came back the next day to finish third in the 5,000-meter run. In July, he improved his 5,000-meter run personal best to 13:06.86 at the Diamond League meeting in Birmingham, England, out-sprinting the reigning world cross country champion, Imane Merga, for second place behind winner, Mo Farah.
At the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, Rupp finished seventh in the 10,000-meter run with a seasonal best of 27:26.84. He then doubled back to run the 5,000-meter, and though he was in the lead with Farah with a little more than a lap remaining, he was out-kicked and finished in ninth place with a time of 13:28.64.
Rupp finished his track season with a new U.S. record in the 10,000-meter run when he ran in 26:48.00 to finish third behind winner, Kenenisa Bekele, at the Memorial Van Damme meet on September 16, 2011. This time made Rupp the 16th-fastest performer in history for that distance.
2012
Rupp broke Bernard Lagat's U.S. indoor two-mile run record on February 11, 2012, when he won the event at the USA Track & Field Classic meet in Fayetteville, Arkansas, in a time of 8:09.72. (Lagat reclaimed the record in 2013 at the Millrose Games in New York City.) In June, Rupp became the sixth American to break 13 minutes for the 5,000-meter run when he ran 12:58.90 at the Prefontaine Classic. He won the 10,000-meter run at the 2012 United States Olympic Trials in a time of 27:25.33, which set a new Trials record, breaking Meb Keflezighi's time of 27:36.49 from 2004, and secured Rupp's second trip to the Olympic Games.
On June 28, 2012, Rupp broke Steve Prefontaine's last remaining record – his Olympic Trials 5000-meter run record from 1972 – winning the race in 13:22.67.
On August 4, 2012, at the London Olympic Games, Rupp took a surprise silver medal in the 10,000-meter run behind his training partner Mo Farah with a time of 27:30:90, after running his last lap in 53.8 seconds. This was the first time a U.S. man had earned a medal in the Olympic 10,000-meter run in 48 years, the last being Billy Mills's gold in the 1964 Olympics. On August 8, 2012, Rupp advanced to the final of the 5,000-meter run with a sixth-place finish in 13:17.56. Two days later, in the 5000-meter Olympic final, Rupp placed seventh in 13:45.04.
2013
On January 26, 2013, at the indoor Terrier Classic at Boston University, Rupp attempted to break the U.S. indoor one-mile run record, winning with a time of 3:50.92 – the fifth-fastest at the time – in a field that included four other sub-four-minute performers.  Among Americans, Rupp's time was behind only that of Bernard Lagat. Rupp placed second at the Boston Indoor Grand Prix 3,000-meter run. On February 21, 2013, Rupp broke Lagat's national indoor 3,000-meter run record by more than two seconds with a time of 7:30.16 at the XL Galan meet in Stockholm, Sweden.
During the start of his 2013 outdoor season, he did not finish the 5,000-meter run at the Oxy High Performance Meet, but he placed second in the 1,500-meter run with a time of 3:36.98. He placed sixth in the Prefontaine Classic 5,000-meter run. At the 2013 USA Track & Field Championships, he won his fifth-consecutive outdoor 10,000-meter run title, finishing with a time of 28:47.32. His teammate, Dathan Ritzenhein, led the last four laps or so, but he was out-kicked by Rupp in the end. He was also the runner-up in the 5,000-meter run to Bernard Lagat. These finishes qualified Rupp for two events at the IAAF World Championships in Moscow. He raced in the 5000-meter run at the Monaco Diamond League Meet, where there were rumors of him and Lagat going after the U.S. record. However, Rupp came out on top because Lagat did not finish, and no U.S. record was broken that day. At the London Diamond League meet, his last event before Moscow, he raced in the Emsley Carr Mile, in which he was the top American in an international field, even though he is a 10,000-meter run specialist. He set an outdoor personal best of 3:52.11, beating out a field that included his 1,500-meter run specialist teammate Matthew Centrowitz. 
On August 10, 2013, at the 14th IAAF World Championships in Moscow, Russia, Rupp placed fourth in the 10,000-meter run final with a 27:24.39, a seasonal-best performance. He followed up that performance with a time of 13:29.87 run in the 5,000-meter run finals, placing eighth.

He beat second-place finisher, Meb Keflezighi, by over a minute, recording the winning time of 2:11:13 on a warm day in Los Angeles.
A few months later, on July 1, Rupp won the 10,000-meter run at the United States Olympic Trials with a time of 27:55.04, qualifying for the Olympics in a second event. At the same meet, he placed ninth in the 5,000-meter run.

Rupp underwent surgery on October 19 to correct a condition called Haglund's syndrome, a bony bump on his heel that was causing his Achilles tendon to fray. The condition is believed to be a congenital disorder. Rupp has the bumps on both heels, though to date only the left one has been problematic.
2019–2020
Controversy rose when Rupp's former coach Alberto Salazar was accused of providing his athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. In October 2019, Salazar was given a four-year ban from athletics by the United States Anti-Doping Agency.

Personal life
Rupp is married to Keara Rupp. They have four children: twins Emmie and Grayson (born in July 2014), Jaden (born in November 2016) and Lucas (born in February 2019).
Doping controversy
Rupp's former coach Alberto Salazar was at the center of doping allegations in 2015. In October 2019, it was announced that Salazar, as well as Nike consultant Dr. Jeffrey Brown, would be banned from the sport for a period of four years due to the trafficking of testosterone, the prohibited use of L-carnitine and tampering with doping controls. Salazar disputes the findings and plans to appeal. In January 2020, Rupp announced his new coach would be Mike Smith, who is the head coach at Northern Arizona University.
