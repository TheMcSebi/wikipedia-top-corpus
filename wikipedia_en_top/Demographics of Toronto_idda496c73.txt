Demographics of Toronto
The demographics of Toronto, Ontario, Canada make Toronto one of the most multicultural and multiracial cities in the world. In 2016, 51.5 percent of the residents of the city proper belonged to a visible minority group, compared with 49.1 percent in 2011, and 13.6% in 1981. Toronto also has established ethnic neighbourhoods such as the multiple Chinatowns, Corso Italia, Little Italy, Little India, Greektown, Koreatown, Little Jamaica, Little Portugal and Roncesvalles, which celebrate the city's multiculturalism. Data from the suburban municipalities are also included for some metrics as most of these municipalities are part of the Toronto CMA (not to be confused with the Greater Toronto Area).

2011 Census population data for the City of Toronto are found readily aggregated at a finer level than the city as a whole at i. the electoral district (riding) level (2003 redistribution) and ii. the neighbourhood level.

Pie chart of the ethnic breakdown of Toronto from the 2016 census.
The 2016 Census indicates that 51.5% of Toronto's population is composed of visible minorities, compared with 49.1% in 2011, and 13.6% in 1981.
According to the 2011 National Household Survey (NHS), 1,264,395 racialized people, or 20.2% of Canada's visible minority population, live in the city of Toronto; of this, approximately 70 percent are of Asian ancestry. Annually, almost half of all immigrants to Canada settle in the Greater Toronto Area. A study released by the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) in December 2012 found that 66 percent of students ages 4 through 18 came from visible minorities. East Asians made up the largest ethnic group (33 percent), with South Asians (28 percent) coming in second of the city of Toronto's overall population.
In particular, the progression of the percentage of visible minorities in the city of Toronto from 2006 to 2021 has been as follows:

Ridings
The finest granularity of visible minority data in Toronto readily available by the 2016 Census is that of the federal electoral district (riding; 2013 redistribution). The per-riding data based on the 2003 redistribution was available for the 2001 and 2006 censuses and the 2011 NHS, thus enabling useful comparisons. For instance, visible minorities as a percentage of the population only marginally increased, or even decreased (Toronto-Danforth, Parkdale-High Park, Toronto Centre, and, in the 2006–2011 period, Davenport) in the "Old" Toronto, East York and South Etobicoke ridings, while on the other hand increased significantly in Scarborough and North York. Since the 2016 Census used the then-new 2013 redistribution, such a direct comparison is no longer possible.
