Qedarites
The Qedarites were a largely nomadic ancient Arab tribal confederation centred in the Wādī Sirḥān in the Syrian Desert. Attested from the 8th century BC, the Qedarites formed a powerful polity which expanded its territory over the course of the 8th to 7th centuries BC to cover a large area in northern Arabia stretching from Transjordan in the west to the western borders of Babylonia in the east, before later moving westwards during the 6th to 5th centuries BC to consolidate into a kingdom stretching from the eastern limits of the Nile Delta in the west till Transjordan in the east and covering much of southern Palestine, the Sinai Peninsula and the Negev.
The Qedarites played an important role in the history of the Levant and of North Arabia, where they enjoyed close relations with the nearby Canaanite and Aramaean states, and became important participants in the trade of spices and aromatics imported into the Fertile Crescent and the Mediterranean world from South Arabia. Having engaged in both friendly ties and hostilities with the Mesopotamian powers such as the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian empires, the Qedarites eventually became integrated within the structure of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. Closely associated with the Nabataeans, the Qedarites might have eventually been absorbed by them.
The Qedarites also feature within the scriptures of Abrahamic religions, where they appear in the Hebrew and Christian Bible and the Qurʾān as the eponymous descendants of Qēḏār/Qaydār, the second son of Yīšmāʿēʾl/ʾIsmāʿīl, himself the son of ʾAḇrāhām/Ibrāhīm. Within Islamic tradition, some scholars claim that the Islamic prophet Muḥammad was descended from ʾIsmāʿīl through Qaydār.
Name
The name of the Qedarites is recorded in Old Arabic inscriptions written using the Ancient North Arabian script as 𐪄𐪕𐪇 (QDR).
The name of the Qedarites is recorded in Aramaic as 𐡒𐡃𐡓𐡉𐡍 (QDRYN) in Achaemenid and Hellenistic period ostraca found at Maresha.
Assyrian records have transcribed in Neo-Assyrian Akkadian various variants of the name of the Qedar tribe under the forms of Qidri, Qīdri, Qidrāya, Qidari, Qadari, Qādri, Qidarāya, and Qudari. In one Neo-Assyrian letter, the Qedarites are referred to as Gidrāya, reflecting the use of a voiced qāf, similarly to the one used in the present-day Ḥijāzī dialect of Arabic.
In the Hebrew Bible, the Qedarites are referred to in Hebrew as Qēḏār (קֵדָ֥ר; Ancient Greek: Κηδάρ, romanized: Kēdár), meaning "black" and "swarthy," in reference to the colour of their tents.
The Qedarites were also mentioned in Old South Arabian inscriptions as the 𐩤𐩵𐩧𐩬 QDRN (Qadirān or Qadrān).
Latin sources mention the Qedarites as the Cedrei.
Geography
During the second half of the 9th century BC, the Qedarites were living to the east of Transjordan and to the south-east of Damascus, within the southwestern Syrian Desert in the region of the Wādī Sirḥān, more specifically in the Jauf depression in its eastern part, where was located the Qedarites' main centre of Dūmat or ad-Dūmat (Old Arabic: 𐪕𐪃𐪉, romanized: DMT; recorded in Akkadian as Adummatu). ad-Dūmat's location halfway between Syria and Babylonia and halfway between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Aqaba, as well as its richness in water and its orchards, which made it the most important oasis of all North Arabia and gave it the position of being a main stop on the roads which connected al-Ḥīra, Damascus and Yaṯrib.
At the time of the 7th century BC, the Qedarites had expanded eastwards so that their kingdom adjoined the western border of Babylonia, In the western Syrian Desert, the Qedarites adjoined the western section of the Fertile Crescent on the eastern border of the Levant, and before the conquest of Syria by the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the neighbours of the Qedarite Arabs to the west were the Aramaean kingdom of Damascus and the Canaanite kingdoms of Ammon, Edom, Israel, and Moab. After the Neo-Babylonian Empire destroyed the Canaanite kingdoms of Ammon, Judah, and Moab, followed by the Persian Achaemenid's annexation of Babylonia, the Qedarites expanded westwards into the eastern and southern Levant until their territory included the northern Sinai and they controlled the desert region which bordered Palestine and the eastern border of Egypt and of the Nile Delta.
Identitfication
The Qedarites were an Arab tribal confederation who were closely related to the other ancient Arab populations of North Arabia and the Syrian Desert. Under the reigns of the Neo-Assyrian kings Aššur-aḫa-iddina and Aššur-bāni-apli, Assyrian records referred to the Qedarites as being almost synonymous with the Arabs as a whole.
Although the Assyriologists Friedrich Delitzsch, R.C. Thompson and Julius Lewy had identified the Qedarite tribe of the Šumuʾilu with the Biblical Yīšməʿēʾlīm (Ishmaelites), and considered the Akkadian name Šumuʾilu as derivative of Yīšməʿēʾlīm, the scholar Israel Ephʿal has criticised this identification on several grounds:
History
Neo-Assyrian period
During the 9th century BC, the Qedarite confederation was centred around the region of the Wādī Sirḥān, and it had commercial interests in the trade and border routes of the Syrian desert. To the west, the borderlands of the Qedarites bordered on the powerful kingdoms of Damascus and Israel in the west, although the Qedarites themselves were independent of Damascene hegemony. The earliest known activities of the Qedarites date from between 850 and 800 BC, when their king Gindibuʾ allied with his powerful neighbours, the kings Hadadezer of Aram-Damascus and ʾAḥʾāb of Israel, against the rising Neo-Assyrian Empire. Although Gindibuʾ's kingdom was not in danger of being attacked by the Assyrians, the Qedarite rulers participated in the trade which passed through Damascus and Tyre, and Damascus and Israel controlled crucial parts of the trade routes as well as the pastures and water sources which were of vital importance to the nomadic Qedarites, especially in drought periods. This meant that the rise of Assyrian power in the 9th century BCE put the desert and border routes where Gindibuʾ had economic interests under threat of Assyrian disruptions, fearing which Gindibuʾ led 1000 camelry troops at the battle of Battle of Qarqar in 853 BCE on the side of the alliance led by Aram-Damascus and Israel against Šulmānu-ašarēdu III of Assyria.
Before the ascent of Assyrian hegemony, the Qedarite confederation was a polity of significant importance in the region of the Syrian Desert, and, beginning in the 8th and lasting until the 5th or 4th centuries BCE, the Qedarites were the hegemons among the Syrian Desert nomads, dominating the northwestern section of the Arabian peninsula in alliance with the local rulers of the kingdom of Dadān.
The alliance of Qarqar soon fell apart after Hadadezer of Damascus died and was succeeded by his son Ḥazaʾēl, who declared war on Israel and killed its king Yehōrām and the Judahite king ʾAḥazyāhū near Ramoth-Gilead in 842 BC; the consequent ascension of Yēhūʾ to the Israelite throne did not end the hostilities between Damascus and Israel. Despite this significant change, the Qedarites continued enjoying good relations with Damascus.
Šulmānu-ašarēdu III later campaigned to Damascus and Mount Ḥawrān in 841 BCE, but his inscriptions mentioned neither the Qedarite kingdom nor Gindibuʾ himself or any successor of his. The Qedarites were not mentioned either in the list of rulers, including those of distant places such as Philistia, Edom, and Israel, who paid tribute to Adad-nirari III after the latter's defeat of Bar-Hadad III of Damascus in 796 BCE. This reason for absence the Assyrian records is that the kingdom of Gindibuʾ was far from the campaign routes of the Assyrians during the later 9th century BCE.
Following the rise in the Armenian highlands of a powerful rival of the Neo-Assyrian Empire the form of the kingdom of Urartu, which, just like Assyria, was interested in the rich states of northern Syria, in 743 BC the Assyrian king Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III started a series of campaigns in Syria which would result in this region's absorption into the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and the first phase of which was the defeat in that very year of an alliance consisting of Urartu and the Aramaean states of Melid, Gurgum, Kummuḫ, Bēt-Gūš, and ʿUmqi, after which he besieged Bēt-Gūš's capital of Arpad, which was Urartu's principal ally, for two years before capturing it. While Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III was campaigning against Urartu in 739 BC, the Levantine states formed a new alliance, headed by the king ʿAzriyau of Ḥamat, and including various Phoenician cities ranging from ʿArqat to Ṣumur and multiple Aramaean states from Śamʾal in the north to Ḥamat in the south, which was defeated by Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III in 738 BC.
After this triumph of Assyrian hegemony in the western Fertile Crescent, the rulers of Damascus, Tyre and Israel accepted Assyrian overlordship and paid tribute to Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III. Since the Qedarite rulers participated in the trade which passed through Damascus and Tyre, they sought to preserve the Arabian commercial activities and the revenues that they acquired from these, and consequently the Qedarite queen Zabibe joined the kings Raḍyān of Damascus, Menaḥēm of Israel, Ḥirōm II of Tyre, as well as other various rulers from southern Anatolia, Syria and Phoenicia in acknowledging Assyrian hegemony and paying tribute to Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III in 738 BC. The tribute of Zabibe consisted of camels, but did not include frankincense or perfumes as the Qedarites would later offer the Assyrians because they had not yet become participants in the trade of aromatics produced in South Arabia. Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III's inscriptions recording this tribute payment constitutes the first explicit mention of the Qedarites by name.
During the 8th century itself, the North Arabian region acquired increased economic importance, with the northern Ḥijāz becoming a transit zone for the trade of goods imported from ʿAsīr and from Africa across the Red Sea. This, in turn, led to increasing interest to control this region by the Assyrians. 
Once Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III had returned to Assyria, the king Raḍyān of Damascus organised an anti-Assyrian alliance in Syria which was supported by Peqaḥ of Israel and Ḥirōm II of Tyre, and which started a revolt against Assyrian hegemony by the cities on the coast of the Levant. Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III retaliated by campaigning in 734 BC against the southern Levantine coast until the Brook of Egypt and successfully managed to establish control over the commercial activities between the Phoenicians, the Egyptians and the Philistines. Among the many rulers in the western Fertile Crescent who pledged allegiance to Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III as result of this campaign in Palestine was the Qedarite queen Šamši.
Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III's campaign had not only disrupted the interests of Tyre, Damascus, Israel and the Qedarites but also resulted in the formation of a pro-Assyrian alliance consisting of ʾArwad, ʾAšqalōna and ʿAza, soon joined by Judah, Ammon, Moab, and Edom, who became players in Syrian politics with the goal of countering the anti-Assyrian alliance led by Damascus, Israel, Qedar and Tyre. However, the alliance headed by Damascus continued its anti-Assyrian activities, which caused the pro-Assyrian alliance to disintegrate, with ʾAšqalōna and Edom soon defecting to the pro-Assyrian side. And since the Qedarites were still participating in the trade networks passing through Damascus and Israel, who themselves controlled important parts of the Arabian commercial route as well as pasture and water sources on which the Qedarites depended, especially during periods of drought, Šamši followed Raḍyān, Peqaḥ, and Ḥirōm II in rebelling against Assyrian authority in 733 BC.
During the reign of Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III itself, the Qedarites invaded Moab and killed the inhabitants of its capital city of Qir-Mōʾāb.
When Judah remained loyal to Assyria, Raḍyān and Peqaḥ attacked it, starting the Syro-Ephraimite War, in retaliation of which Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III in turn attacked Damascus in 733 and 732 BC. As part of his intervention in Syria, Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III also attacked and defeated the Qedarites in the region of Mount Saqurri (the Jabal ad-Durūz), forcing Šamši to flee to the Wādī Sirḥān, and taking significant spoils from them, including spices, which are first mentioned in relation with the Qedarites in Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III's records relating to this campaign, and cultic utensils like the resting places of the Qedarite gods as well as their goddess's sceptres. While Raḍyān would be executed and his kingdom annexed by the Assyrians and Peqaḥ was assassinated, Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III allowed Šamši to retain her position as the ruler of the Qedarites and appointed an Arab as qēpu (overseer for the count of Assyria) in Qedar to prevent her from providing aid to Damascus during the campaign in which the Assyrians annexed its territory, and to manage the Qedarites' commercial activities. This mild treatment of Šamši was due to the fact that the Qedarites by then had become wealthier and more powerful, and the Assyrians were interested in products, such as camels, cattle and spices which they could obtain from the Qedarites, as well as in preserving the administrative and social structures of the peoples of the Assyrian border regions who played an important role in international commerce and thus ensured the stability of the Neo-Assyrian Empire's economy. The arrangement between the Assyrians and the Qedarites established at the end of Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III's Palestinian campaign satisfied both parties enough that Šamši remained loyal to Assyria and later paid Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III a tribte of 125 white camels. Among the other Arabian populations around the southern Levant who offered tribute to Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III after his Palestinian campaign were the Masʾaya. the Taymanites, Sabaean traders established in the Ḥijāz, the Ḫaipaya, the Badanaya, the Hatiaya, and the Idibaʾilaya.
The Assyrian annexation of the kingdoms of Damascus and later of Israel would allow the Arabs, including the Qedarites, to expand into the pastures within the settled areas of these states' former territories, which improved their position in the Arabian commercial activities. The Assyrians would allow these nomad groups to graze their camels in the settled areas and integrate them into their control structure of the border regions of Palestine and Syria, which consisted of a network of sentry stations, check posts and fortresses at key positions, and administrative and governmental centres in the cities, and which would ensure that these Arabs would remain loyal to the Assyrians and would prevent the encroachment of other Arab nomads on the settled areas; thus, several letters to Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III by two Assyrian officials stationed in the Levant, respectively named Addu-ḫati and Bēl-liqbi, mention the participation of Arabs in several caravanserais in the region, including the one located at Ḫiesa; moreover, one Arab chief from Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III's time, named Badiʾilu, was given a grazing permit and appointed as an official of the Assyrian administration as part of this policy. This in turn allowed the Arabs integrated into the Assyrian administration to further expand into the Levantine settled regions around Damascus and the Anti-Lebanon until the Valley of Lebanon.
In 729 BC, Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III proclaimed himself King of Babylon, thus marking the renewal of the importance of southern Mesopotamia and starting the resurgence of Babylon. This revival was itself related to the formation of new commercial links between Babylonia and the Persian Gulf and its surrounding regions, which would eventually lead to Aramaeans as well as Arabs moving into the region.
After the annexation of the kingdom of Israel to the Neo-Assyrian Empire by the Assyrian king Šarru-kīn II in c. 720 BC, the Assyrians transferred some Arabs to the territory of the former kingdom as well as to the southern border regions of Palestine, and some sedentary Qedarites might have been present among the Arabs resettled by the Assyrians as colonists in the hill country around Samaria to perform economic activities as part of the Assyrian diversion of some of the Arab trade to Tyre through Samaria so as to increase both Assyrian control over it and imperial revenue from this commercial traffic. These Arab colonists introduced the cult of the god ʾAšīmaʾ in the region of Samaria.
Due to the revival of Babylonia which had started under Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III, Arab nomads had also migrated over the course of the middle 8th century BC to the east into Babylonia, where they settled down and either founded their own settlements or became the majority population in pre-existing local settlements there. These Arabs appear to have moved into Babylonia from the Wādī Sirḥān region, passing through the Jawf depression and along the road near the city of Babylon which went from Yaṯrib to Barsip , before finally settling into Bīt-Dakkūri and Bīt-Amukkani, but not Bīt-Yakīn or the region of the Persian Gulf; the name of one of these settlements, Qidrina, located in the territory of Bīt-Dakkūri, suggests that these Arab incomers might have been connected with the Qedarites, and the Arab population in Babylonia remained in close contact with the Qedarites in the desert, who by this time had expanded eastwards so that they adjoined the western border of Babylonia. These Babylonian Arabs might have been settled in Mesopotamia by the Assyrian kings themselves, especially by Šarru-kīn II and his son and successor Sîn-ahhī-erība, and some of these might have in turn been resettled in Media as camel tamers by the Assyrians after they had introduced the use of the dromedary in this region.
In 716 BC, the Qedarite queen Šamši joined a local Egyptian kinglet of the Nile Delta and the mukarrib Yiṯaʿʾamar Watar I of Sabaʾ in offering lavish presents consisting of gold, precious stones, ivory, willow seeds, aromatics, horses, and camels to the Assyrian king Šarru-kīn II to normalise relations with Assyria and to preserve and expand their commercial relations with the economic and structures of the newly established western borderlands of the Neo-Assyrian Empire following the Assyrian annexation of Damascus and Israel. Assyrian records referred to these three rulers as the "kings of the seashore and the desert," reflecting their influence in the trade networks which spanned North Arabia, the Syrian desert, and the northern part of the Sinai.
In the late 8th century BC, shortly before 700 BC, the domestication of the camels had made it possible for the Arabs populations to travel further south the Arabian Peninsula, thus competing with the regional maritime trade routes. During the 7th century BC, this ability to travel so far to the south led to the establishment of the import of frankincense from the kingdom of Sabaʾ, thus forming the incense trade route, and further increasing the commercial importance of the northern Ḥijāz and of Palestine and Syria and the adjoining regions. And, under Šarru-kīn II, the Arabs within Syria, who may or may not have included Qedarites, were continuing to participate in the caravan traffic in close cooperation with the Assyrian authorities, especially in the area of the Ḥomṣ plain, which itself extended eastwards towards Palmyra, and where these Arabs were allowed to graze their camels. As part of this collaboration, the Assyrian official Bēl-liqbi, who was stationed in Ṣupite, wrote a letter to Šarru-kīn II demanding the permission to transform an old caravanserai which had since become an archers' camp back into a caravanserai. During this period, the Assyrians imposed prohibition on selling iron, which was important for Assyrian armament, to the Arabs to prevent them from developing more efficient weaponry, and instead permitted only copper to be sold to them. Some Arabs, of unclear relation with both those which were then moving into Babylonia and the Qedarites, were at this time also living in Upper Mesopotamia, where they might have been settled by Šarru-kīn II and Sîn-ahhī-erība, and where their camels used to graze between Aššur and Ḫindanu, under the authority of the governor of Kalḫu. Due to inadequate rainfall, the governor of Kalḫu lost control of these Upper Mesopotamian Arabs, who in 716 BC engaged in raids in the regions around Suḫu and Ḫindanu and even further south-east till Sippar, possibly with the support of Assyrian officials.
The increased importance of Babylonia during this period was reflected by several anti-Assyrian revolts in Babylonia led by Marduk-apla-iddina II and supported by Elam, and when he recaptured Babylon and revolted against the Assyrians again in 703 BC with the support of the Elamites, the Qedarites supported him, with this policy of theirs being motivated by the trade relations which existed between Qedar and Babylon. One of the Arab supporters of Marduk-apla-iddina II, a chieftain by the name of Bašqanu, was captured by the Assyrian king Sîn-ahhī-erība when he suppressed the Babylonian revolt that same year. This Bašqanu was the brother of an Arab queen named Yaṯiʿe, who appears to have been a Qedarite queen and a successor of Šamši; the Qedarites had thus adopted the policy of supporting Assyria's enemy once Syria was firmly under Assyrian control after the previous one and half a century of trying to remain on good terms with the powers governing Syria, including Assyria.
During his repression of the Babylonian revolt in 702 BC, Sîn-ahhī-erība also attacked several Arab walled towns surrounded by unwalled villages in Babylonia, although it is unclear what relation existed between these Arabs and the Qedarites despite some of these settlements having names including Arabic components which would later be borne by several Qedarite kings, such as Dūr-Uait (from Arabic Yuwaiṯiʿ) and Dūr-Birdada in Bīt-Amukkani, and Dūr-Abiyataʾ (from Arabic Abyaṯiʿ) in Bīt-Dakkūri; among the settlements attacked by Sîn-ahhī-erība was Qidrina, in the territory of Bīt-Dakkūri, suggesting that these Babylonian Arabs might have been connected with the Qedarites.
Through a series of campaigns conducted from 703 to 700 BC, Sîn-ahhī-erība was able to establish control over the settled parts of Babylonia, as well as over the nomads of the desert to the immediate west of it, and according to his annals, members of the Taymanites and of the Qedarite sub-group of the Šumuʾilu, the latter of whom lived in the eastern Syrian Desert bordering on Babylonia, went to offer him tribute in the late 690s at the Assyrian capital of Nineveh, where they had to pass through a then recently built gate of the city called the abul madbari (Desert Gate).
Although Sîn-ahhī-erība had regained control of Babylon in 703 BC, the Babylonians revolted against Assyrian rule with Elamite help yet again in 694 BC, and the Qedarites supported them again. As part of Sîn-ahhī-erība's repression of this new rebellion, which would end with the destruction of the city of Babylon itself in 689 BC, in 691 BC he conducted a campaign against the Qedarites, who by then had grown enough powerful to pose a danger to Assyrian interests. At this time, the Qedarites were ruled by Yaṯiʿe's successor, the priestess-queen Teʾelḫunu and her husband, the king Ḥazaʾil, and who were attacked by the Assyrians while encamped in an oasis in the western borderlands of Babylonia; Teʾelḫunu, who had come with the nomads to invade the settled areas attacked by the Qedarites, stayed behind in a camp behind the frontlines to remain out of danger should the Qedarite forces be defeated. Teʾelḫunu and Ḥazaʾil fled deep into the desert, to the Qedarite capital of ad-Dūmat, where the Assyrians overtook and captured Teʾelḫunu and her daughter Tabūʿa, and took them as hostages to Assyria along with the idols of the Qedarites' gods, and continued pursuing the Qedarites until Kapanu near the eastern border of the Canaanite kingdom of Ammon, following which Ḥazaʾil surrendered to Sîn-ahhī-erība and paid him tribute. The rich booty captured by the Assyrians at ad-Dūmat included camels as well as luxuries which the Qedarite rulers had acquired from the Arabian trade routes, such as spices, precious stones, and gold.
Teʾelḫunu was taken to the Assyrian capital of Nineveh in 689 or 698 BC, where Sîn-ahhī-erība raised her daughter Tabȗa, following the Assyrian practice of controlling vassal populations by raising their rulers at the Assyrian court, while Ḥazaʾil had retained his position, but as an Assyrian vassal, and he sent Sîn-ahhī-erība continuous tribute until the latter's death. Sîn-ahhī-erība also retained the idols of the Arabian gods as a way to ensure that they would remain loyal to Assyrian power, and as a punishment against them in accordance to his heavy handed policy with respect to Babylonia and its surrounding regions. From this period onwards, the Assyrians would attempt to control the North Arabian populations through vassals, although these vassals would themselves often rebel against the Neo-Assyrian Empire.
When Sîn-ahhī-erība's son Aššur-aḫa-iddina succeeded him in 681 BC, Ḥazaʾil went to Nineveh to request from him that Tabȗa and the idols of the Qedarite gods be returned to him. Aššur-aḫa-iddina, after having had his own name as we as "the might of Aššur" inscribed on the idols, acquiesced to Ḥazaʾil's demand in exchange of an additional tribute of 65 camels, with this light tribute being motivated by Aššur-aḫa-iddina's desire to maintain Ḥazaʾil's loyalty. This was motivated by Aššur-aḫa-iddina's view that the desert populations were required to maintain control of Babylonia, hence why he adopted the same conciliatory attitude towards the Arabs that he had towards Babylonia itself, and Ḥazaʾil in consequence ruled over the Qedarites as an Assyrian vassal, and Aššur-aḫa-iddina soon allowed Tabȗa to return to ad-Dūmat and appointed her as queen of the Qedarites at some point before 678 or 677 BC. Around the same time, Ḥazaʾil died and was succeeded as king by his son Yauṯaʿ ben Ḥazaʾil with the approval of Aššur-aḫa-iddina, who demanded from him a heavier tribute consisting of 10 minas of gold, 1000 gems, 50 camels, and 1000 spice bags. Yauṯaʿ agreed to these conditions due to his dependence on Assyria and to consolidate his precarious position of rulership.
Ḥazaʾil and his son Yauṯaʿ might have been seen as Assyrian agents by the Qedarites, and, some time between 676 and 673 BC, one Wahb united the Arab tribes in a revolt against Yauṯaʿ ben Ḥazaʾil. The Assyrians intervened by suppressing Wahb's rebellion and capturing him and his people and deporting them to Nineveh to be punished as enemies of the king of Assyria.
When the Assyrians invaded Egypt in 671 BC, Yauṯaʿ ben Ḥazaʾil was one of the Arab kings summoned by Aššur-aḫa-iddina to provide water supplies to his army during the crossing of the Sinai Desert separating southern Palestine from Egypt. Yauṯaʿ however soon took advantage of Aššur-aḫa-iddina being preoccupied with his operations in Egypt to rebel against Assyria, likely in reaction to the hefty tribute required from him. The Assyrian army intervened against Yauṯaʿ and defeated him, and captured the idols of the Qedarites, including that of their god ʿAttar-Samē, while Yauṯaʿ ben Ḥazaʾil himself fled, leaving the Qedarites king-less for the rest of Aššur-aḫa-iddina's rule.
After Aššur-aḫa-iddina died and was succeeded as king of Assyria by his son Aššur-bāni-apli in 669 BC, Yauṯaʿ ben Ḥazaʾil returned, and requested from the Assyrian king the return of the idol of ʿAttar-Samē, which Aššur-bāni-apli granted after Yauṯaʿ swore his allegiance to him.
Yauṯaʿ ben Ḥazaʾil however soon led the Qedarites and the other Arab peoples into rebelling against the Assyrians, although the Nabataean king Nadnu refused when approached by join the revolt by Yauṯaʿ, who, along with the king ʿAmmu-laddin of another sub-group of Qedarites, attacked the western regions of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in Transjordan and southern Syria, while Yauṯaʿ's wife ʿAṭīya, who had come with the nomads to invade the settled areas attacked by the Qedarites, stayed behind in a camp behind the frontlines to remain out of danger should the Qedarite forces be defeated. The Assyrian troops stationed in the region, from Ṣupite to Edom, and the armies of the local Assyrian vassal kings, especially of Moab, repelled the Arab attacks, with ʿAmmu-laddin being defeated and captured by the Moabite king Kamasḥalta. Kamasḥalta and the Assyrian army then carried out counter-attacks against the Arab camps, burning down their tents, capturing ʿAmmu-laddin and ʿAṭīya, and taking so many people, donkeys, camels, sheep, and goats, that it caused a drastic drop in the prices of slaves and camels in Assyria. The Qedarites were so severely defeated and Assyrian influence had increased so much in the desert that Yauṯaʿ himself was unable returning to his tribe to resume his rule, and he was instead forced to flee to the territory of the Nabataeans, whose king Nadnu refused to grant him asylum and instead swore allegiance to the Assyrians and handed over Yauṯaʿ to Aššur-bāni-apli, who punished Yauṯaʿ by imprisoning him in a cage.
One Abyaṯiʿ ben Teʾri, who appears to have been unrelated to Yauṯaʿ, became king of the Qedarites with Assyrian approval after going to Nineveh to swear his allegiance to Aššur-bāni-apli and pledge to pay him tribute.
When Aššur-aḫa-iddina's elder son, Šamaš-šuma-ukin, who had succeeded him as king of Babylon, rebelled against his brother Aššur-bāni-apli in 652 BC, Abyaṯiʿ supported the revolt; this Qedarite policy towards the Assyrians was dictated by their interests in the trade routes in the region, which were threatened by Assyrian encroachment. Abyaṯiʿ, along with his brother Ayammu, as well as Yauṯaʿ ben Ḥazaʾil's cousin, the king Yuwaiṯiʿ ben Birdāda of the Šumuʾilu, led a contingent of Arab warriors to Babylon, where they arrived shortly before Aššur-bāni-apli besieged the city. The Qedarite troops were defeated by the Assyrian army and they retreated into Babylon, where they became trapped once the siege had started. Shortly before the Assyrians stormed Babylon and destroyed the city, the Arabs tried to break out of the city, but they were defeated again by the Assyrians.
While the Arab intervention in Babylonia in support of Šamaš-šuma-ukin was happening, Yauṯaʿ ben Ḥazaʾil, who was still a prisoner in Assyria, went to Nineveh to attempt to request Aššur-bāni-apli to restore him as king of the Qedarites. Aššur-bāni-apli however saw Yauṯaʿ as incapable of regaining his leadership over the Qedarites and instead punished him for his previous disloyalty.
Following the complete suppression of the Babylonian revolt in 648 BC, while the Assyrians were busy until 646 BC conducting operations against the Elamite kings who had supported Šamaš-šuma-ukin, the southern Phoenician cities and the kingdom of Judah seized the opportunity and rebelled against Assyrian authority. Taking advantage of this situation, the Qedarites, led by Abyaṯiʿ, Ayammu, and Yuwaiṯiʿ ben Birdāda, allied with the Nabataeans led by Nadnu, conducted raids against the western borderlands of the Neo-Assyrian Empire ranging from the Jabal al-Bišrī to the environs of the city of Damascus, and were able to intensify their pressure on the areas of the Middle Euphrates and of Palmyrena. The Assyrian general Nabȗ-šum-lišir, who served in the region of the south-west border of Babylonia at the time of Šamaš-šuma-ukin's rebellion, is known to have led an attack against the Qedarites and to have defeated them around this time.
Once the Assyrian war in Elam was complete, in 645 BC Aššur-bāni-apli attacked the Qedarites and the Nabataeans during a three-months campaign with the goal of subjugating the Arabs permanently. The Assyrian armies first attacked from Ḫadattā, passing through the desert between Laribda, Ḫuraruna and Yarki before reaching Azalla after defeating the joint forces of the Qedarites, Nabataeans, and another tribe, the Isammeʾ, in the region between Yarki and Azalla; the Assyrians then proceeded from Azalla to Quraṣiti, where they attacked Yuwaiṯiʿ ben Birdāda, who fled, captured his mother, sister and family, many prisoners, as well as donkeys, camels, sheep, and goats, and seized the tribe's idols, and dispatched them all through the Damascus road; finally, the Assyrians marched out from Damascus till Ḫulḫuliti, and from there carried out their final attack on the Arabs near the Mount Ḫukkurina (one of the elevations of the al-Lajāʾ), where they captured Abyaṯiʿ and Ayammu, the latter of whom was flayed alive. Due to the Assyrian campaign, the Šumuʾilu rebelled against Yuwaiṯiʿ ben Birdāda and handed him over to the Assyrians. After the victory over the Qedarites, the Assyrians campaigned against the Nabataeans.
Neo-Babylonian period
After Aššur-bāni-apli's death, the Babylonians led by Nabû-apla-uṣur and the Medes led by Cyaxares rebelled against Assyrian rule again, this time culminating in their destruction of the Neo-Assyrian Empire over the course of 614 to 609 BC. This transitional period saw a resurgent Egypt trying to preserve the Neo-Assyrian Empire and establish its rule on the Levant only for the newly established Neo-Babylonian Empire to gain the upper hand and seize all of Syria and Palestine when Nabû-apla-uṣur's son and successor Nabû-kudurri-uṣur II defeated the Egyptians at Kargamiš in 605 BC. It is unknown what was the role of the Arab populations during these events, although the Qedarites appear to not have pressed against the Transjordanian region during the period which oversaw the collapse of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and its replacement by the Neo-Babylonian Empire, and the Canaanite kingdoms of Palestine were strong enough to resist the Arabs once the region had come under Babylonian hegemony.
Within Palestine itself, the Judahite king Yahuyaqim was initially an Egyptian ally until the Babylonian triumph of 605 BC forced him to change his alignment and become a Babylonian vassal. After the attempt by Nabû-apla-uṣur's son and successor, Nabû-kudurri-uṣur II, to invade Egypt itself failed in 601 BC, the Babylonian control over Syria became weaker, and Nabû-kudurri-uṣur II had to reorganise his army in Babylon and could not carry out military activities, allowing Yahuyaqim to rebel against Babylonian rule and to realign himself with Egypt, thus allowing the southern Canaanite kingdoms of Ammon, Edom, Judah and Moab, as well as the Qedarites, to ally with Egypt while leaving the Babylonian provinces of central and southern Syria which directly depended on the Babylonian military vulnerable to attacks from the Arabs, including the Qedarites.
Nabû-kudurri-uṣur II responded by personally returning to Syria in 599 BC, establishing his base possibly in Damascus, and conducting raids over the course of 599 to 598 BC against the Qedarites from his Syrian provinces with the aim of pacifying the desert, and culminating in the Babylonians capturing the idols of the Qedarites' gods, thus placing them under Babylonian overlordship. This led to Ammon and Moab defecting to the Babylonian side and joining Babylonian subjects in Damascus in attacking Judah. In 597 BC, Nabû-kudurri-uṣur II himself attacked Judah, captured its king, the son and successor of Yahuyaqim, Yekonyah, and turned it into a Babylonian vassal.
Following a domestic revolt in Babylon in 594 BC, the new king of Judah, Ṣidqiyahu, organised an anti-Babylonian meeting supported by Egypt in Jerusalem in which Ammon, Edom, Moab, Sidon and Tyre participated, and to which the Qedarites were also aligned. Since the Babylonians had important interests in the trade from South Arabia which passed through the Ḥijāz and the Negev, once Nabû-kudurri-uṣur II managed to repress the revolt in Babylon, in 587 BC he attacked and annexed Judah and one year later started the siege of Tyre as part of operations meant to neutralise and control the various Canaanite states which had participated in these anti-Babylonian activities, thus bringing an end to this latest anti-Babylonian endeavour. With the solidification of Babylonian control in Palestine, Edom, which at this time controlled North Arabian territory until as far south as the oasis of Dadān, became a centre of Babylonian influence in Arabia. After Nabû-kudurri-uṣur II annexed the Canaanite kingdoms of Judah in 587 BC and of Ammon and Moab in 582 BC, the resulting power vacuum in Transjordan allowed the Arabs of the Syrian desert, including the Qedarites and the Nabataeans, to expand into these former states' settled territories close to the desert, including across southern Transjordan and Palestine until the Judaean hills, where they remained throughout the existence of the Neo-Babylonian Empire and cohabited with the sedentary Ammonite, Moabite, and Edomite populations, with whom these Arab incomers mingled over several generations.
In the spring of 553 BC, the Babylonian king Nabû-naʾid went to Syria, from where he campaigned against Edom, captured its capital, and then marched to Taymāʾ, Dadān (whose king was defeated by Nabû-naʾid), Fadak, Ḫaybar, Yadiʿ, and Yaṯrib. The Qedarites initially supported the Dadānites against Nabû-naʾid, but the Babylonians soon defeated the Qedarites and reimposed Babylonian rule over them. With Edom destroyed by the Babylonians, the Arab populations, including the Qedarites, filled the power vacuum left in the northern Ḥijāz.
Achaemenid period
When Kūruš II conquered the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BC, the Arab populations of the Syrian desert and of North Arabia, including the Qedarites, as well as the desert routes going into Mesopotamia from these regions, became part of his Persian Achaemenid Empire. Within Achaemenid Syria, the Qedarites and the Nabataeans formed the major Arab groups.
After the Qedarites provided Kūruš II's successor Kaᵐbūjiya II with water in the Sinai Desert during his preparations for conquering Egypt, the Achaemenid kings granted the Qedarite king a coastal emporium exempt from taxes ranging from ʿAza to Ienysus, within the fifth satrapy inhabited by the Phoenicians which went from the eastern border of Cilicia till ʿAza and continuing from Ienysos till Lake Serbonis. This emporium allowed the Qedarites to reduce the costs of transporting spices by redirecting the spice trade towards ʿAza, where the Qedarite involvement in the spice trade ended once the goods reached the coasts and were shipped out, rather than towards more distant Tyre, which in turn also permitted the Qedarite kings who surpervised the spice trade to sell their products to Phoenician as well as Greek traders. An important economic reason why this coastal emporium had been granted to the Qedarite kings was so they, rather than the imperial authorities would be allowed to collect customs duties on the trade of spices, aromatics and other luxuries, such as frankincense, myrrh, cassia, cinnamon, and gum mastic, passing through Transjordan and ʾAylat till ʿAza, in return of which the Qedarites had to provide the Achaemenid authorities with annual payments of 1000 talents (30 tons) of frankincense; this situation suggests that the Qedarites enjoyed very good relations with the Persian Achaemenid authorities. At this time, the territory of the Qedarites in the east might perhaps become reduced so that it no longer bordered on Babylonia and maybe no longer controlled even the areas of the middle Euphrates region or the desert regions leading from Syria the middle Euphrates.
The various Arab populations of the Achaemenid Empire appear to not have rebelled during the period of political turmoil following the death of Kaᵐbūjiya II, and some of them appear to have even offered their services as camel-mounted warriors to the new king Dārayavaʰuš I when he crossed the Tigris river to repress the revolt of Babylon; some of these camelry contingents might also have helped him cross the Isthmus of Suez during his repression of the revolt of Egypt. After Dārayavaʰuš I reorganised the empire into several provinces called satrapies, the kingdom of the Qedarites became part of the satrapy of Arabāya, which was itself closely associated with the Assyrian, Babylonian and Egyptian satrapies in Achaemenid inscriptions.
In the mid-5th century BC, the Qedarites were ruled by the king Gešem ben Šahr, who enjoyed a prominent status within the Achaemenid administration and controlled the region to the south of Judaea in his role as an imperial official in Dadān, which is attested in the form of a Dadanitic inscription in which he is mentioned alongside the governor of Dadān, reading 𐪈𐪑𐪚𐪃 𐪔𐪆𐪃 𐪈𐪌 𐪆𐪀𐪇 𐪅𐪒𐪑𐪕 𐪐𐪂𐪉 𐪕𐪕𐪌 (bʾym Gšm bn Šhr wʿbd fḥt Ddn, lit. 'in the time of Gešem ben Šahr and ʿbd the governor of Dadān'; the title FḤT, lit. 'governor' is unattested in Arabian languages and is a loanword from Akkadian bel pīḫati, thus implying that the region was under Achaemenid rule), being evidence that Gešem was not the governor of Dadān but nevertheless held an important position as the oasis. Like the earlier Qedarite rulers, Gešem had important interests in the trade passing through North Arabia into southern Palestine, and his fear of a resurgence of Judah led him to oppose Nəḥemyāh in 445 BC after the later rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem.
With Achaemenid approval, the Qedarites and the Nabataeans soon expanded their territory during the 5th century BC to the west into the southern and eastern Levant, which put the Qedarites in control of the Negev and the northern Sinai till they were adjoining the eastern borders of Lower Egypt and southern Palestine, more specifically in the region to the immediate south of Judaea and east of the Nile Delta, and the approach of the Wādī Ṭumīlāt, where the Qedarites acted as a garrison which protected the local border for the Achaemenids and protected the Canal of the Pharaohs dug by Dārayavaʰuš I, and helped the imperial authorities prevent any further revolt of Egypt, while the border town of Daphnae acted as a garrison against the Arabs and the populations of Syria. Within Lower Egypt itself, the Qedarites expanded into its 20th nome of Lower Egypt until as far as the Wādī Ṭumīlāt's western end at Bubastis and northwards along the Pelusian branch of the Nile till the ruins of Pi-Ramesses, with their new Egyptian territories including fine agricultural land between what are presently Ṣafṭ al-Ḥinnā and Qantīr, and grazing land in the Wādī Ṭumīlāt itself. As a result of this Qedarite expansion, the region to the east of the Pelusian branch of the Nile became known as "Arabia" (Ἀραβίη, romanized: Arabíē), the mountainous areas to the east of Yānaw as the "Arabian Mountains" (Ἀραβίης ὄρος, romanized: Arabíēs óros), and the Gulf of Suez as the "Arabian Gulf" (Ἀράβιος κόλπος, romanized: Arábios kólpos); the Qedarite kingdom at this time thus covered an area ranging from the eastern limits of the Nile Delta in the west till Transjordan in the east and including the whole Sinai peninsula and the northern Ḥijāz, and their western expansion allowed them to control a large territory stretching from the Egyptian city of Pithom (presently Tall al-Masḫuṭa) in the eastern Nile Delta through the Negev till Transjordan, due to which the parts of Gešem's kingdom of "Arabia" located to the east of the Nile Delta and around Pithom became known to ancient Egyptians as Gsm (𓎤𓊃𓅓𓏏𓊖) and to Jews as the ʾEreṣ Gōšen (אֶרֶץ גֹּשֶׁן), that is the lit. 'Land of Gešem'), after either Gešem himself or after his dynasty. The Qedarite expansion also pressured many Edomites out of their traditional homelands, forcing them to resettle as Qedarite vassals into the southern parts of the former kingdom of Judah which became known as Idumaea, although the bulk of the population of the former territories of Edom as well as of the newly formed Idumaea appears to have consisted of both Edomites and Qedarites, as well as a Jewish minority in the region of Baʾēr Šebaʿ.
This expansion placed the Qedarites at the head of the important trade network which existed between ʿAza on the Mediterranean Sea and ʾAylat on the Red Sea, as well as in control of the northern end of the both the marine and overland branches of commercial traffic of the incense trade route which flowed from South Arabia to ʿAza, with ʿAza itself being under Qedarite rule; attesting of this important role of the Qedarites in the Arabian trade is an inscription from the South Arabian kingdom of Maʿīn, reading 𐩲𐩧𐩨𐩺𐩩 𐩨𐩬 𐩤𐩵𐩧 (ʿRBYT BN QDR, lit. 'an Arabian woman from Qedar'); the resulting expanded influence of the Qedarites in Egypt is reflected in the construction of a shrine to al-ʾIlāt, who was the main goddess of the Qedarites, in Pithom, which was itself located on the principal road between the Gulf of Suez and the Nile Delta.
Thanks to the Achaemenid Empire's multinational structure and its policy of tolerance and the end of any independent polities within Transjordan and Palestine, these Arab groups became integrated into the Persian Empire's economic, administrative, and military systems, with this process also being driven by the development of trade in Arabia as well as the military activities of the Achaemenid kings due to which warriors from all the populations ruled by their empire, including those from the Arab peoples, required their enrollment into the Achaemenid army. Thus, in 480 BC, camel-riding Arab units participated in the Achaemenid king Xšayār̥šā I's invasion of Greece, under the command of R̥šāmaʰ along with the Nubian units of the Achaemenid army.
Gešem was succeeded by his son Qainū, who is known to have offered a silver bowl in dedication to a shrine of the goddess al-ʾIlāt at Pithom; the silver bowl had an Aramaic inscription on it, reading 𐡆𐡉 𐡒𐡉𐡍𐡅 𐡁𐡓 𐡂𐡔𐡌𐡅 𐡌𐡋𐡊 𐡒𐡃𐡓 𐡒𐡓𐡁 𐡋𐡄𐡍𐡀𐡋𐡕 (zy Qynw br Gšmw mlk Qdr qrb l-hnʾlt, lit. 'that which Qainū son of Gešem, king of Qedar, brought-in-offering to han-ʾIlat', with han-ʾIlat being the Aramaic form of the goddess's Arabic name of al-ʾIlāt).
Achaemenid rule over the Transjordanian Arabs lasted until Egypt under Amyrtaeus rebelled against Persian rule over the course of 411 to 404 BC and embarked on anti-Persian activities in Palestine, Phoenicia and Cyprus, at the same time that Euagóras I in the latter location rebelled against the Persian Empire, which was itself facing a number of internal crises which greatly weakened it. In this situation, Persian rule broke down in Transjordan, which became independent, although Arab units of the imperial army nevertheless participated in the empire's overseas and coastal military activities in 410 and 386 BC when the Achaemenid Empire became involved in the latter phases of the Peloponnesian War on the side of Sparta. The Qedarites appear to have enjoyed good relations with the rebel kings who ruled during the brief period of Egyptian independence from Persian rule which lasted from 404 to 343 BC, and during this time the Qedarite territory expanded westwards beyond Ienysos till it adjoined Pelusium.
These circumstances saw the formation of an alliance of sorts between the enemies of the Achaemenid Empire and of its Spartan ally, consisting of Athens, Euagóras I's kingdom in Cyprus, Egypt, and Qedar. This new coalition itself came to an end after Sparta, supported by the Persians, ended the Peloponnesian War by defeating Athens only to support the rebellion of 401 BC by Kūruš the Younger against his brother the Achaemenid king Artaxšaçāʰ II with the hope of extending its control over Ionia; once Kūruš's rebellion had failed, the Athenians and Euagóras I became the supporters of the Achaemenids against Sparta. This new alliance also fell apart once Sparta was defeated in 394 BC, following which all the Greek cities, including Athens, made peace with the Persian Empire in 386 BC. The role of the Qedarites in these subsequent developments is however unknown.
Later, after the Egyptian king Teos was overthrown by Nectanebo II in 358 BC, he passed through the territory of the Qedarites to flee to the court of Artaxšaçāʰ II.
After the Achaemenid Artaxšaçāʰ II's reconquest of Egypt in 343 BC, he placed Phoenicia and Arabia, including the Qedarite kingdom, under the authority of a single satrap.
Hellenistic period
During the Macedonian conquest of the Achaemenid Empire by Aléxandros III of Macedon, the Qedarites in ʿAza assisted the Persian troops in resisting his siege of the city.
The Qedarites remained independent after Aléxandros III's conquest as well as during the time of the Hellenistic states established by the Diádokhoi. Their Nabataean neighbours at this time lived to the south of the Arnon river.
During the post-Achaemenid period, the whole of the area to the east of the Nile Delta became included in the Qedarite-inhabited territory named "Arabia," although during the 4th century BC, the Nabataeans replaced the Qedarites as the Arab group in control of the Negev, and therefore of the trade route connecting ʿAza to ʾAylat, and the Qedarites themselves might have soon been absorbed by the Nabataeans.
Roman period
The Roman Syrian Christian theologian Theodṓrētos claimed that the Qedarites were still living in the region neighbouring Babylon in the 5th century AD.
Legacy
The practice of local empires using Arab nomads to guard their borders which started with the Assyrians integrating the Arabs of the Syrian Desert into the control system of their Syrian and Palestinian borders would continue throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages, with the later Byzantine Empire assigning the role of guarding their Syrian and North Arabian borders to the Ġasāsina Arabs, up till the modern period, when the Ottoman Empire placed similar responsibilities of guarding their southern Syrian and Transjordanian borders on the local Bedouin tribes.
Graeco-Roman
Due to increased contacts between Greece and Arabia over the course of the 4th century BC, the First Delphic Hymn to the Greek god Apollo mentions "Arab smoke" (Ancient Greek: Άραψ ατμός, romanized: Áraps atmós) which is spread towards Olympus, as a reference to the use in Apollo's cult of frankincense which was imported through Qedarite Arabia.
Mythological
The ancient Greek historian Herodotus of Halicarnassus, repeating local folk tales, claimed that the part of the Qedarite kingdom located immediately to the east of Egypt was inhabited by "winged snakes" which would migrate into Egypt proper during each spring, where they would be killed by ibis birds, due to which the Egyptians allegedly considered it a sacred bird. According to Herodotus, the mythical phoenix bird also lived in this part of the Qedarite kingdom, from where it would bring its father's remains to the temple of Ra in the Egyptian city of Yānaw every 500 years.
Biblical
The Qedarites appear in the Hebrew Bible as a tribe descended from Qēḏār, the second son of Yīšmāʿēʾl, himself the son of ʾAḇrāhām and Hāgār, In the Bible, Yīšmāʿēʾl's eldest son Nəḇāyōṯ is given prominence due to the rule of primogeniture, with Qēḏār also being given some level of prominence due to being the second-born son, making him the closest of Yīšmāʿēʾl's sons to the one standing for primogeniture.
The name of Qedar is often used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to Arabia and Arabs in general, and in a Biblical prophecy, the Juhadite prophet Yīrmiyāhū used the names of Kittīm (Cyprus) and Qēḏār to refer, respectively, to the western and eastern cardinal points.
The Qedarites capital of ad-Dūmat also appears in the Hebrew Bible, where its population is represented by the sixth son of Yīšmāʿēʾl, Dūmā, and his descendants. Although the descendants of Dūmā had been tentatively identified with Dūmā (now Deir ed-Dōmeh) near Hebron, or with Mount Seir near Edom, they have since been more decisively and accurately identified with the Qedarite centre of ad-Dūmat.
The Land of Goshen
The parts of Gešem's kingdom of "Arabia" located to the east of the Nile Delta and around Pithom became known to ancient Egyptians as Gsm (𓎤𓊃𓅓𓏏𓊖) and to Jews as the ʾEreṣ Gōšen (אֶרֶץ גֹּשֶׁן), that is the lit. 'Land of Gešem'), after either Gešem himself or after his dynasty; according to the Book of Genesis, when the sons of Yaʿaqōb settled down in the ʾEreṣ Gōšen migrated to Egypt.
Although the scholar John Van Seters has opposed the identification of ʾEreṣ Gōšen with the Qedarite territories in eastern Egypt based on claims that the Qedarites never ruled the region of the Wādī Ṭumīlāt, the discovery in the Wādī Ṭumīlāt region of Qedarite remains, such as a shrine to the goddess al-Lāt, makes Van Seters's opposition to this identification untenable.
Islamic
The tradition of claiming descent from Ibrāhīm's son ʾIsmāʿīl, called "genealogical Ishmaelism," was already present among some pre-Islamic Arabs, and, in Islamic sources, ʾIsmāʿīl is the eponymous ancestor of some of the Arab peoples of north-west Arabia, with prominence being accorded to his two eldest sons, Nābit (نابت) or Nabīt (نبيت) (Biblical Nəḇāyōṯ) and Qaydar (قيدر) or Qaydār (قيدار; Biblical Qēḏār), who lived in eastern Transjordan, Sinai and the Ḥijāz, and whose descendant tribes were the most prominent ones among the twelve tribes of the Ishmaelites.
According to Islamic tradition, the Islamic prophet Muḥammad is believed to have been a descendant of ʾIsmāʿīl through either Nābit or Qaydār depending on the scholar.
According to the scholar Irfan Shahîd, genealogical Ishmaelism was academically viewed with suspicion due to confusion in the Islamic period which led to ʾIsmāʿīl being considered as the ancestor of all Arabian tribes. According to Shahîd, genealogical Ishamelism in its original variant is instead more limited and applicable to only some Arab tribes.
Culture and society
Qedarite society consisted of both nomads and sedentary villagers who primarily reared sheep, goats, and camels. The nomadic Qedarites lived in black tents made of goat's and camel's hair and unfortified temporary settlements and were constantly on the move along with their flocks, while the sedentary population was concentrated around the oasis centre of ad-Dūmat, which functioned as their economic, administrative and religious centres, and where was located the permanent houses of thousands of agriculturists and craftsmen.
Because the Qedarites and the Nabataeans were neighbours and often cooperated with each other, the two tribes were often listed together in Assyrian, Biblical and Graeco-Roman sources.
Social organisation
The large size of the area inhabited by the Qedarites, centred around the al-Jauf depression and ranging from the eastern border of Egypt till the western border of Babylonia, suggests that Qedar was a tribal federation made up of multiple sub-groups. The rules of Yauṯaʿ ben Ḥazaʾil and of ʿAmmu-laddin at the same time, and the attempt of Wahb to take over kingship of the Qedarites, as well as the replacement of Yauṯaʿ ben Ḥazaʾil by Abyaṯiʿ ben Teʾri as king of the Qedarites, all suggest that Qedar was a federation with multiple internal divisions, especially since both Wahb and Abyaṯiʿ appear to have been neither related to the family of Yauṯaʿ nor being members of their tribe. Leadership over the whole of the Qedarite federation could instead be transferred from one of its constituent tribes to another.
The Qedarites appear to have been ruled by several queens who resided in the confederation's centre of ad-Dūmat.
One of the tribes which constituted the Qedarites were the Šumuʾilu, who appear to have lived in the eastern desert immediately adjoining the western borderlands of Babylonia, due to which a text from the time of the Assyrian king Sîn-ahhī-erība mentioned them and the Taymanites as passing through the abul madbari (Desert Gate) of Nineveh together to offer tribute to the king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The Šumuʾilu were led by Yuwaiṯiʿ ben Birdāda at the time of Aššur-bāni-apli and Šamaš-šuma-ukin.
Language
The Qedarites were an Arab people whose main language was Old Arabic, which they wrote using the Ancient North Arabian script, as attested by the personal names of several of their rulers:
The Qedarites also spoke Aramaic, with the names of some their kings being in Aramaic, such as Ḥazaʾil, and ʿAmmu-laddin (lit. 'may my ancestor judge!').
Dress
In Assyrian reliefs from the reign of Tukultī-apil-Ešarra III, the Qedarite queen Šamši is depicted in one scene as a tribute-bearer wearing a long dress and a veil covering her head, and holding a bag, probably containing spices.
The ancient Greek historian Herodotus of Halicarnassus recorded that Arab infantry and camelry contingents of the Achaemenid army wore belted tunics.
Both Biblical and ancient Greek sources describe the Qedarite Arabs as having "cropped hair," with Herodotus of Halicarnassus claiming that the cropping of the hair by Arabs was part of oath-giving traditions involving the gods ʿAttar-Samē and Attar-Quruma.
Religion
The Qedarites practised the ancient North Arabian polytheistic religion, including the worship of idols of their six deities, whose names are attested as ʿAttar-Samē, Dāya, Nuhay, Ruḍaw, Abbīr-ʾilu. and ʿAttar-Kirrūm. In addition, the name of some Qedarite kings contained theophoric elements referencing the deities YṮʿ, WṮʿ, and DD.
The celestial god ʿAttar-Samē (𐪒𐪉𐪇𐪊𐪃, ʿTRSM in Dumaitic Old Arabic; recorded in Neo-Assyrian Akkadian as Atar-Samayin, reflecting the Aramaic form ʿAttar-Šamāyīn), was a local hypostasis of the Semitic deity ʿAṯtar, and was closely connected to the king of the Qedarites. ʿAttar-Samē was the god representing the planet Venus, and his epithet Samē (Old Aramaic: Šamāyīn; lit. 'of the Heavens') refers to his manifestation in the skies. Attesting of the significant Aramaean-Canaanite and Mesopotamian cultural impact on the Qedarites is the fact that the earliest record of the god ʿAttar-Šamāyīn is from an early Aramaic cylinder-seal dating from the 9th century BC belonging to one ʿbd ʿtršmyn (𐡀𐡁𐡃 𐡀𐡕𐡓𐡔𐡌𐡉𐡍, lit. 'servant of ʿAttar-Šamāyīn'), with the epithet Šamāyīn being also assigned to the Syro-Canaanite god Hadad in his hypostasis of Baʿal-Šamāyīn (lit. 'Lord of the Heavens'). Although ʿAṯtar was a masculine deity throughout Arabia, he might have also experienced substantial influence from Mesopotamian religion, especially from the goddess Ištar, who was a feminine Mesopotamian variant of ʿAṯtar; the name of ʿAttar-Samē/ʿAttar-Samāyīn, which means "ʿAttar of Heaven," also reflected the possible influence on this deity of Ištar's form as Ištar ša Šamȇ (𒀭𒀹𒁯 𒊭 𒀭𒂊, lit. 'Ištar of Heaven'), as well as that of the Syro-Canaanite variant of ʿAṯtar, the goddess ʿAštart, who was worshipped as the MLKT H-ŠMYM (𐤌𐤋𐤊𐤕 𐤄𐤔𐤌𐤉𐤍; lit. 'Queen of Heaven') and was also identical with and identified with Ištar.
The Qedarites also worshipped ʿAttar-Kirrūm, whose name meant "ʿAṯtar of the Rainfall,"  and was a hypostasis of ʿAṯtar representing him as a provider of fertility through the rain.
The Arab goddess al-ʾIlāt was the main goddess of the Qedarites, and the 5th century BC king of Qedar, Qainū, dedicated a silver bowl in which she is referred to in Aramaic as han-ʾIlat to her shrine located in the Egyptian city of Pithom.
The main religious centre of the Qedarites was their capital of ad-Dūmat, where was performed the cults of ʿAttar-Samē, Nuhay, and Ruḍaw. The queen of the Qedarites, who lived in ad-Dūmat was also a priestess with sacral duties, as documented in the Assyrian records which referred to the queen Teʾelḫunu as the apkallatu (𒊩𒀊𒆗𒆷𒌓, lit. 'priestess', cognate with Old South Arabian 𐩱𐩰𐩫𐩡𐩩, ʾfklt) of a local goddess; the kings of the later Aramaised Arabs of Ḥaṭrāʾ would use a masculine variant of this title in the Aramaic form ʾpklʾ (𐣠𐣰𐣪𐣫𐣠).
Economy
The Qedarites participated in the extensive trade networks spanning the Syrian desert during the Iron Age. They reared sheep, donkeys, goats, and camels to be traded along these commercial routes, most especially with the Phoenician city of Tyre, and also participated in the trade of spices, aromatics such as frankincense, precious stones, and gold from South Arabia. Under the rule of the Achaemenid Empire, the Qedarites controlled the northern end of both the maritime and overland the Arabian trade routes of the incense trade route through which spices, aromatics and other luxuries, such as frankincense, myrrh, cassia, cinnamon, and gum mastic, which flowed from South Arabia to the Mediterranean port of ʿAza, which was under Qedarite rule.
The Qedarites also traded gold and precious stones, which they offered annually to the Assyrian Empire as part of their annual tribute.
Warfare
The Qedarites were proficient warriors whose skill in archery were mentioned in Assyrian records as well as in the Hebrew Bible. The ancient Greek author Herodotus of Halicarnassus recorded that they were equipped with longbows in Achaemenid times.
