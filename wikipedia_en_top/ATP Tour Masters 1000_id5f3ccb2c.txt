ATP Tour Masters 1000
The ATP Masters 1000 tournaments (previously known as ATP Masters Series) is an annual series of nine tennis tournaments featuring the top-ranked players on the ATP Tour since 2009. The Masters series' events have been held in Europe and North America since the inception of ATP Tour in 1990, and also in Asia since 2009. The ATP Masters tournaments along with the Grand Slam tournaments and the Year-end Championships make up the most coveted trophies on the annual ATP Tour calendar, in addition to the Olympics, hence they are collectively known as the 'Big Titles'.
Novak Djokovic holds the record for the most Masters singles titles with 38. By completing the set of all nine Masters singles titles in 2018, Djokovic became the first and only player to achieve the Career Golden Masters. In 2020, Djokovic completed a second Career Golden Masters.
In doubles, the Bryan brothers (Bob and Mike) have won a record 39 doubles titles as a team. Daniel Nestor and the Bryan brothers are the only doubles players who have achieved the Career Golden Masters.
History
The Masters series was introduced in 1990 with the inception of the ATP Tour by bringing together the nine most prestigious tournaments of the preceding Grand Prix tennis circuit. Results in ATP Masters events earn players more ranking points than regular tournaments but less than Grand Slam events or the year-end ATP Finals. Up until 2007, most Masters finals were contested as best-of-five-set matches, but from 2008 all events were decided in best-of-three-set matches.
As part of a shake-up of the tennis circuit in 2009, the Masters Series became the ATP Tour Masters 1000, with the addition of the number 1000 referring to the number of ranking points earned by the winner of each tournament. Contrary to earlier plans, the number of tournaments was not reduced from nine to eight and the Monte-Carlo Masters remained part of the series although, unlike the other events, it does not have a mandatory player commitment. The Hamburg Masters event was downgraded to an ATP Tour 500 event. The Madrid Masters moved to May and onto clay courts. A new tournament in Shanghai replaced the Hamburg Masters and took over Madrid's former October indoor slot. In 2011, six of the nine Masters level tournaments were combined ATP and WTA events.

In 2009, the Shanghai Masters replaced the Madrid Open, which was until then held as an indoor event, in the eighth slot of the year with the Madrid Open switched to clay courts, replacing the Hamburg Open in the spring clay court season. The Shanghai Masters was designated as an outdoor event despite the facility having a retractable roof and having been used as the indoor venue for the ATP Finals from 2005 until 2008.
