Toyota 86
The Toyota 86 and the Subaru BRZ are 2+2 sports cars jointly developed by Toyota and Subaru, manufactured at Subaru's Gunma assembly plant.


The 2+2 fastback coupé has a naturally-aspirated boxer engine, front-engined, rear-wheel-drive configuration, 53/47 front/rear weight balance and low centre of gravity; it was inspired by Toyota's earlier AE86, a small, light, front-engine/rear-drive Corolla variant widely popular for Showroom Stock, Group A, Group N, Rally, Club and drift racing.
For the first-generation model, Toyota marketed the sports car as the 86 in Asia, Australia, North America (from August 2016), South Africa, and South America; as the Toyota GT86 in Europe; as the 86 and GT86 in New Zealand; as the Toyota FT86 in Brunei, Nicaragua and Jamaica and as the Scion FR-S (2012–2016) in the United States and Canada.
The second-generation model is marketed by Toyota as the GR86 as part of the Gazoo Racing family.


Name
The development code of the 2+2 was 086A and the eight six (Hachi-Roku in Japanese), references the historic Toyota 2000GT, 1983 to 1987 AE86 and Sports 800.
Pre-launch concept cars
Initial layout and design elements for the 86 were presented by Toyota using its "FT" (Future Toyota) concept car nomenclature. The first was the Toyota FT-HS, which was presented at the North American International Auto Show in 2007. It had a front engine, rear-wheel drive layout and 2+2 seating and was powered by a V6 engine with hybrid electric assistance. In 2008, Toyota bought 16.5% of Fuji Heavy Industries, which includes the Subaru automotive brand. Toyota, led by project leader Tetsuya Tada, then invited Subaru to partner in the project, by co-developing the new D-4S boxer engine. The offer, which conflicted with Subaru's reputation for high performance all-wheel drive (AWD) cars, was rejected. The project came to a six-month halt before Toyota invited journalists and Subaru engineers to test a developmental prototype. Following the test, Subaru agreed to become further involved in development.
The collaboration produced a concept car, the FT-86 Concept, which debuted at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 2009. Smaller than the FT-HS, the design of the FT-86 was further refined by Toyota's ED2 design studio while the hybrid V6 powerplant was replaced by the new D-4S boxer. Subaru provided the chassis, modifying it from their Impreza. The custom red paint was based on the backside of a Japanese macaque.
At the 2010 Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota launched its G Sports line of aftermarket accessories, along with the FT-86 G Sports concept car. It featured G Sports carbon fibre panels, a vented bonnet, rear wing, 19 in (48 cm) wheels, Recaro race seats, and an interior rollcage. The D-4S engine also added a turbocharger.
In 2011, Toyota and Subaru unveiled five near-production concept cars to show their progress with the project. The first, known as the FT-86 II Concept, was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2011. ED2 refined the design of the initial FT-86, by developing new front and rear fascias, and marginally increasing the dimensions of the concept. At the same show, Subaru unveiled a transparent silhouette of the car showing the new D-4S boxer engine and displayed the "Boxer Sports Car Architecture".
Scion followed in April 2011 at the New York International Auto Show with the FR-S Sports Coupé Concept, co-developed with aftermarket tuner Five Axis. Another semi-transparent Subaru concept, known as the BRZ Prologue, was shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show that September, followed in November at the Los Angeles Auto Show by the BRZ Concept STi, the first full mock-up of Subaru's version of the 86 with input from Subaru Tecnica International (STI).
First generation (ZN6/ZC6; 2012)
Development and production
The production Toyota 86 debuted at the December 2011 Tokyo Motor Show. Its development was led by chief engineer Testuya Tada. All variants are built at Subaru's Gunma Main Plant, with the first cars assembled on 2 February 2012 before sales began in March and deliveries in April. 7,000 orders were placed for the Toyota 86 in the first month of production, while Subaru took in 3,500 orders.
In the United States, Scion were allocated 10,000 units of the 2013 model year (MY13) production, while Subaru was limited to only 6,000 units.
Engineering
The 86's low-weight design uses an aluminium hood, a fixed roof, and a trunk as opposed to a hatchback. To improve driving dynamics, the boxer engine is mounted low in a front engine / rear drive layout, yielding a weight distribution of 53% in front and 47% in the rear and a low centre of mass height.
The 86's engine, known by the Toyota code 4U-GSE and Subaru code FA20, is a naturally aspirated engine that uses Subaru's flat-four engine design, with the addition of Toyota's D-4S injection system, which uses Gasoline direct injection (GDI). With its front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, its engine runs on 98 RON (premium unleaded) fuel and features a compression ratio of 12.5:1 with a bore and stroke of 86 mm (3.39 in) for a total displacement of 2.0 L; 121.9 cu in (1,998 cc) that results in 200 PS (197 bhp; 147 kW) at 7,000 rpm and 151 lb⋅ft (205 N⋅m) of torque at 6,400 rpm.
The 86, BRZ and FR-S are offered with two 6-speed transmissions: an in-house developed Toyota TL70 manual gearbox (based on Aisin AI's AZ6) and an Aisin-Warner A960E automatic transmission, which is modified from that used on the Lexus IS 250. The latter uses a traditional wet torque converter design, but its software has been engineered to mimic the response of a dual-clutch transmission. The automatic transmission uses three different modes: Sport, Snow, and Normal. A torsen style limited slip differential is standard on most models.
The vehicles are offered with 16" steel and alloy wheels shod with Yokohama dB Decibel E70 tyres in 205/55 size or 17" alloy wheels shod with Michelin Primacy HP tyres in 215/45 size, depending on sales market. The limited editions Toyota Racing Development (TRD) GT86 models are instead offered with 18" forged aluminium wheels, which are shod with either Yokohama Advan Sport tyres or Michelin Pilot Sport 3 tyres in 225/40 size, also depending on market. The braking systems vary between models and countries:
Suspension design comprises front MacPherson struts and double wishbones at the rear.
In 2016, for the 2017 model year, the 86 was upgraded to 153 kW (205 bhp; 208 PS) and 212 N⋅m (156 lb⋅ft). The final drive ratio was lowered from 4.1 to 4.3.
Design
The 86's rear-wheel drive configuration and front-mounted flat boxer engine allow a low centre of gravity for strong handling characteristics. The bodywork has a drag coefficient of Cd=0.27.
According to the 86's designers, "The goal was to create an authentic rear-wheel drive sports car with compelling style, exceptionally balanced performance and handling, flexible utility and surprising MPG." When asked about the TRD version of the car, the lead engineer Mr. Tada said "There is definitely going to be a more TRD oriented variant down the line. However any of the parts that would be standard on the TRD model will fit on your current Toyota 86 so there is no need to wait."
The 86 "boxer" side badge appears on all Toyota and Scion versions of the car, but not the Subaru BRZ. Aside from badging, the main differences between the 86/GT86 and the BRZ are the front grilles and bumper bars.
The car included numerous references to the number 86:
Interior
The interior uses low mounted front seats and fold down rear enabling increased storage space. The FR-S and base 86 models have cloth seats with all black interior trim with a black patterned dash trim, and shift boot red stitching. The BRZ has two available interiors, one identical to the FR-S but with silver dash trim, a red stitched parking brake boot, black gauge faces (instead of the white tachometer of the 86 GTS models) and a touch-screen navigation head unit; the second interior to leather and Alcantara heated seats, automatic HVAC controls, and a push-button start. The top-of-the-range 86 models are fitted like the BRZ except as noted above, and the Japanese interior can be had in black/red leather and Alcantara or full black leather and Alcantara.
Performance
Toyota 86, GT86 and FT86
The Toyota 86 is available in Japan from Toyota's Netz Store and Corolla Store line of dealerships; the 1980s Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno were sold at the same networks. Four trim levels are offered, with the RC model being the base aimed at people wishing to modify or race their vehicles. This model is available with only a 6-speed manual transmission and comes with unpainted bumpers and mirrors, 16 inch steel wheels, simpler interior trim components, analogue speedometer and no stereo or air conditioning. Outside Japan, the RC model is only available in New Zealand. The G model adds all the interior components missing from the RC, plus a fully painted exterior and 16 inch alloy wheels and the availability of an automatic transmission. The GT86 model adds high intensity discharge headlights with LED daytime running lights, fog lamps, automatic climate control, keyless start with engine start button, 17 inch alloy wheels, chrome exhaust tips, white tachometer face with analogue and digital speedometer, silver accents on the centre dash and steering wheel, aluminium pedals. The top-of-the-range GT Limited adds leather and Alcantara seating and a rear spoiler.
In Europe, GT86 models are generally the same as the Japanese 86 GT with a red/black leather/Alcantara interior with red stitching. In the United Kingdom, the Japanese G model is sold as the GT86 Primo and the car has also been available as a limited edition Toyota Racing Development "TRD GT86", which features: 18 inch forged aluminium wheels with Yokohama Advan Sport tyres; full bodykit with front and side skirts, rear spoiler and new diffuser; quad-exhaust system; TRD-branded detailing on the filler cap, radiator cap and gear knob. In New Zealand, the TRD 86 is sold with the above features except for Michelin Pilot Sport 3 tyres instead plus upgraded TRD braking system. Options not available to all markets include a Bose sound system upgrade.
In Australia, the GT is the equivalent of the Japanese G model but with only an all black interior trim and standard radio head unit, whereas the top-of-the-range GTS model is the equivalent of the Japanese GT Limited except for an all black leather/Alcantara and red-stitch interior trim only and touchscreen multimedia head unit. Upon Australian launch in June 2012, all models for Australia featured a full-size spare wheel, the GTS lacked a rear spoiler, and a limited slip differential or LSD was standard on all models except automatic GT's. The full-size spare wheel was phased out after the first shipments to Australia, replaced with a repair kit. This model also benefited from a remapping of its Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to address initial reports of rough idling and stalling. The range of models and main options had the following retail prices: GT manual A$29,990; GT automatic A$32,490; GTS manual A$35,490; GTS automatic A$37,990; metallic paint A$425 for all models; "Aero pack" bodykit A$3,000 for GTS only.
As of the August 2013 production update (which carried the formal year designation MY14), the automatic GT also gained LSD as standard (but with a price increase of A$300; manual price unchanged in Australia) and the GTS gained the same rear spoiler fitted to the Japanese GTS Limited and the Subaru BRZ (with a price increase of A$500 for both the manual and automatic model in Australia). Other distinguishing features on the MY14 models include the removal of the lettered "TOYOTA" badge from the rear bonnet of the GTS and optional availability of rear parking sonar sensors on GT and GTS.
In July 2014, an updated version of the Australian Toyota 86 range was launched with year designation MY15. The key highlights include: revised suspension settings; "shark-fin" roof antenna; GTS instrument cluster on GT; carbon-fibre look dash insert and reverse-view camera on GTS; new white and silver exterior paints. The price of the GT remained unchanged while the GTS was the subject of a price increase of A$500 and A$800 for the manual and automatic version, respectively.
In late 2014, as part of its MY15 range, Toyota offered in the UK two new models: the GT86 Aero, featuring a full bodykit and 18 inch OZ Ultraleggera alloy wheels in anthracite grey finish; and the GT86 "Giallo" (meaning yellow in Italian), limited to only 86 units. Similar to the latter, Toyota also offered in Italy a total of 50 "Limited Edition" models. Externally, the key distinguishing feature of these limited editions is the new Sunrise Yellow metallic paint and black side stripes (bonnet, roof and bonnet stripes are available in the UK at no extra cost and standard in Italy). The interior is distinguished by a limited edition badge and heated quilt leather seats with yellow 86 logo. The retail price of the Limited Edition in Italy is €28,500, which translates to €1,700 more than the standard base model.
At the same time in Japan, Toyota released the 14R-60 model limited to 100 units, inspired by the GT86 TRD Griffon Project of 2013. Its engine power remains the same as the standard models despite featuring various drivetrain changes such as twin central exhausts, a TRD mechanical LSD, a short-shifter, and revised gearing for the six-speed manual transmission. Other changes include extra body reinforcement, a variable-height coil-over spring suspension setup and more rigid suspension bushings. A TRD bodykit with carbon fibre components is complemented by 18 inch magnesium wheels and, overall, 14R-60 model results lighter than the base model. Inside there are race-style bucket seats with four-point belts, an Alcantara-clad steering wheel, carbon fibre dashboard trim and yellow piping and highlights. Price-wise, this Japan-only model is listed for ¥6,300,000, which is significantly higher than the ¥2,100,000 for the base RC model or ¥3,100,000 for the top-of-the-range GT Limited.
In 2015, the 86xstyle Cb was officially launched after its presentations at the 2013 and 2014 Tokyo Auto Salon. It is characterised by a drastically different front end design with revised lights and bumper bar but standard bonnet. Available in 6-speed manual or automatic transmission, it has revised interior trimmings including a red Cb logo embroidered leather steering wheel, white (instead of red) backlit instruments and a dark woodgrain-style panel across the dashboard. The most peculiar features are the replacement of the front side gills with a set of LED-illuminated fins and optional contrasting colour for the car's upper body section. Another option is different alloy wheels than those fitted as standard on the GT86. On sale from April, this Japan-only model is listed for ¥4,180,000, which is a ¥1,280,000 premium over the regular 86 GT on which this variant is based.
To celebrate Australia's 86 2016 Pro-Am racing series, the following November Toyota launched 450 "Blackline" units (250 of which with manual transmission). Based on the standard GTS model, this limited edition carries a A$2,000 premium because of its cosmetic upgrade with TRD parts and special livery.
In Indonesia, the 86 was launched in 2012. The facelifted version was launched in August 2016. Toyota Indonesia sells the 86 in the TRD package with only an automatic transmission and the non-TRD package with both manual and automatic transmission.
In 2018, Toyota sold a special edition 86 called Apollo Blue to celebrate that the 86 had passed 20,000 units sold in Australia. It features a unique Apollo Blue body colour, black rear spoiler and mirror caps, and is only available with the optional Dynamic Performance Package. It was only sold in Australia and United Kingdom with both manual and automatic transmission options.
Peculiarly, in Jamaica and Nicaragua, the 86 is marketed and sold using one of its pre-launch concept car badges, the "FT-86".
Although BRZ production ended in July 2020, 86 production was to continue at least until the third quarter of 2020.
Subaru BRZ
The BRZ's name comes from three elements: Boxer engine, rear-wheel drive, and Z standing for Zenith. The Subaru BRZ differs from the 86's design in the front fascia, with a different grille and headlight assembly, as well as a different front fender vent. The BRZ's grill is hexagonal in shape, compared to the Toyota's trapezoid. The BRZ features a wraparound of LED parking lights in the headlight assembly, while daytime running lights are integrated into the bumper. The suspension setup of the Subaru is different from the Toyota. Like the Japanese Toyota 86, Subaru offers an RA base model lacking most interior comforts and using 16 inch steel wheels, with the only difference from the 86 RC being that the BRZ RA's bumpers are painted the same colour as the body. Two main trim levels are offered: R trim, known as Premium in North America, and S trim, known as Limited in North America. The most notable differences between the trims being the S trim (Limited) received leather seats with Alcantara inserts that were heated rather than the cloth seats in the R trim (Premium). In Europe and Australia BRZs offer a Toyota stereo unit, while Japanese and North American vehicles use a Subaru unit. Australian BRZs were originally available for sale only online.
In 2013, Subaru unveiled a BRZ tS model for the Japanese market, tuned by STI. The tS model features an improved suspension setup, 18 inch silver BBS wheels, STI bodykit and front spoiler, a larger drive shaft, and Brembo brakes, along with interior changes including a new steering wheel, front seat, gauges, and Alcantara accents. A further tS GT Package includes Recaro seats, black BBS wheels, and an adjustable carbon fibre rear wing. The tS is limited to 500 units in total, with a maximum of 250 of them being the GT package. In 2015, a similar release of 300 units was sold again only in Japan.
In 2014, as part of running changes consistent with those of the MY15 Toyota 86 GTS, the Subaru BRZ also featured a new key fob and two new colours, including ‘WR Blue Pearl’ metallic finish. In addition, Subaru also launched special editions both for the United States and Australia markets. For the former, one thousand BRZ Series. Blue editions were marketed at additional cost, half painted in Blue Pearl and the other half in Crystal Pearl White. This model featured STI body kit parts, 17-inch STI black alloy wheels and red brake calipers. For Australia, Subaru launched a similar variant known as the Special Edition, also at additional cost. It featured stripes across the bonnet, boot and roof; 17-inch STI black alloy wheels; STI boot spoiler plus front, side and rear-side under spoilers; a rear diffuser and a push-button starter switch. It was available in every existing BRZ paint hue.
In 2015, for the 2016 model year, Subaru released the limited edition Hyper Blue range across its WRX, WRX STI and BRZ models. In Australia, the BRZ was limited to 50 units with manual transmission only. This limited edition is characterised by the said blue paint and a host of other cosmetic upgrades.
For the 2017 model year Subaru released another new special edition for the newly redesigned BRZ. This edition is called the Series.Yellow in America which was limited to 500 units but known as the Inazuma Edition in Canada which was limited to between 200-250 cars. This special edition is based on the Limited trim level for the BRZ and features the optional Performance package as standard, which includes 4 piston Brembo brakes in the front, 2 piston Brembo brakes in the rear, and Sachs dampers, a special yellow body colour called Charlesite Yellow with black trim, a yellow embroidered BRZ logo on the seats, and yellow accents and stitching throughout the interior.
In February 2018, Subaru of America released a limited edition SOA 50th Anniversary edition BRZ based on the Limited trim level featuring Heritage Blue exterior colour, satin chrome exterior trim and badging; and SOA 50th anniversary emblem. The interior features black upholstery with contrasting silver stitching; silver seatbelts; and the 50th Anniversary logo embroidered on the front seats and carpeted floor mats. Only 250 were made.
In late July 2020, Subaru ended production of the first-generation BRZ, and no more orders were accepted.
Scion FR-S
In the United States and Canada, the GT86 was initially sold under Toyota's youth-oriented Scion brand, with its name derived from a description of the platform: Front-engine, Rear-wheel drive, Sport. Scion used a simplified "pure price" sales model that eschewed traditional factory options in favor of fixed base-vehicle pricing and buyer customization via dealer-installed accessories; hence, the FR-S was offered in a single standard trim, with exterior colours and the choice of transmission typically being the only factory options. However, Scion offered some limited-production special editions with added factory equipment and exclusive colours.
10 Series
As part of the 10th anniversary of the Scion marque, 2,500 units of "10 Series" FR-S models were released by Scion in June 2013 for the 2013 model year. They were painted in Silver Ignition and fitted with extra equipment, including HID headlights, automatic climate control, push button start, illuminated exterior badges plus shifter knob.
Monogram Series
In January 2014, Scion released the "Monogram Series" limited to 2000 units. Of these, only 25% came equipped with a manual transmission making the rarest examples those delivered in Asphalt (61K) or Hot Lava (H8R) with a manual transmission.
This FR-S closely matched the equipment offered on Toyota's GTS-variant including: heated leather and Alcantara seats; keyless entry with push button start; rear seat centre armrest; frameless rear view mirror; heated side mirrors; automatic high-intensity discharge headlamps with LED daytime running lights; dual-zone climate control; colour-keyed rear spoiler; BeSpoke audio and navigation.
Release Series 1.0
Presented at the April 2014 New York Auto Show and mirroring the European "Giallo" and "Limited Edition" yellow-painted special editions, Scion released 1500 units of the “Release Series 1.0” in similar Yuzu Yellow paint. It features TRD bodykit and quad-tip exhaust system, along with TRD lowered suspension, TRD steering wheel and shift knob and the highest specification (dual A/C, HID headlamps with LED daytime running lamps, push-button start-stop) plus a numbered commemorative plaque near the gearshift lever.
Release Series 2.0
In October 2015, Scion revealed a limited run of 1000 cars called the FR-S Release Series 2.0.
Due to the discontinuation of the Scion marque, in August 2016 the FR-S was re-branded as the Toyota 86 in North America for the 2017 model year and onward.
Scion Carbon Stealth FR-S, Scion FR-S GT, and Scion Minty FReSh
There are 3 versions of 2013 Scion FR-S built with a $15,000 build budget, created as part of the eighth annual Scion Tuner Challenge. The FR-S Tuner Challenge vehicles are the: Carbon Stealth FR-S by John Toca of Chicago, Illinois; FR-S GT by Daniel Song of Orange County, California; Minty FReSh by Chris Basselgia of Lebanon, Pennsylvania.

Subaru STI Performance Concept (2015)
Subaru unveiled the BRZ-based STI Performance Concept at the 2015 New York Auto Show. It stated that this concept car does not preview a production model but rather a visualization of the future application of the STI program to the BRZ. The concept car uses the same turbocharged 2.0-litre engine employed in the BRZ GT300 race car, producing an estimated 220 kW (300 bhp) and 330 lb⋅ft (447 N⋅m). Even so, Subaru also stated that a turbocharger will not find its way into the BRZ production. Mechanically, the concept car has chassis, suspension and brake upgrades from the Japan-only BRZ tS. Externally, it is distinguished by LED headlights and taillights, new-style alloy wheels and a full bodykit featuring new-design front fascia, rear diffuser and rear wing.
Toyota 86 Shooting Brake Concept (2016)
The Toyota 86 Shooting Brake Concept was displayed in Sydney, Australia in 2016. Toyota's global chief engineer Tetsuya Tada saw a quarter scale clay model of the car during a trip to the Australian branch in 2014 and arranged for a full scale, fully function version to be built in Japan by Toyota's Takumi ("artisan") craftsmen. Tada said, “while we never say never, and I would love this concept to become a production reality, it is very much a concept that demonstrates the passion within Toyota for cars that are fun to drive". Commenting on the new car, Toyota's Australian Divisional Manager National Marketing Brad Cramb said: ”The Toyota 86 lends itself perfectly to a concept that expands its appeal with added versatility while retaining its sleek and sporty coupe styling and sharp, responsive driving character”.
Toyota 86 Fujiwara Tofu Shop (2016)
In 2016, Toyota UK created a "Fujiwara Tofu Shop" version of the car as a homage to the manga Initial D and the car the protagonist drives, an AE86 Sprinter Trueno.
Marketing
At the Subaru BRZ's market launch, a 2-part film documented the car's development. In Canada, a TV commercial titled Scorched was shot at Queen and McCaul St. in Toronto.
In Australia, Subaru BRZ was the first new car ever to be sold on that market exclusively online, with orders opening on 16 July 2012. It was also marketed with free servicing for 3 years or 60,000 km. According to Subaru this sale concept was a success, after the entire 2012 Australian allocation of 201 cars was sold in under 3 hours. The first buyer was able to secure their car in less than 20 minutes from the site going live. This sale process was implemented as a consequence of the demand for the Toyota 86 far outstripping supply (resulting in long delivery times) and a low BRZ supplies for Australia. As of 1 January 2014, the vehicle became available both online and at dealerships, with free servicing no longer included in the purchase.
Scion made a similar decision in the United States, creating the 'First 86' program to allow 86 buyers to take delivery of their cars before the general public sales. On 12 January 2012 users had eight hours and six minutes to submit their requests to a program website. Winners were required to take their confirmation number and $500 to a dealer within 96 hours to claim their cars. Scion produced a commercial called Close Call featuring Ken Gushi avoiding a collision with a deer while driving Scion FR-S in Mt. Diablo State Park in Northern California.
A British Toyota GT86 commercial titled The Real Deal was banned for encouraging motorists to drive irresponsibly.
Second generation (ZN8/ZD8; 2021)
The second-generation BRZ debuted on 18 November 2020 and went on sale in the US in late 2021. The badge-engineered Toyota version was introduced later on 5 April 2021, briefly named the "GR 86". It was later renamed "GR86", without the space, for digital marketing reasons.
The roof, hood and front fenders are made from aluminium to lower the vehicle's centre of gravity and reduce the weight gain from the engine and safety features. The second-generation BRZ and GR86 architecture adopts elements from the Subaru Global Platform (SGP), claiming 50 percent more torsional rigidity than its predecessor.
Subaru BRZ
Subaru use the FA24D designation for the new engine. It has a displacement of 2,387 cc (145.7 cu in) using a 94 mm × 86 mm (3.7 in × 3.4 in) bore and stroke, with a power output of 231–235 PS (170–173 kW; 228–232 hp) at 7,000 RPM and a torque output of 250 N⋅m (184 lb⋅ft; 25 kg⋅m) at 3,700 RPM. According to Subaru, a naturally aspirated engine was chosen to meet the goal of developing "the ultimate pure sports car". Compared to the previous gen FA20 it retains a free-revving character, with a larger bore increasing peak torque at a lower rpm.
Vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission include Subaru's advanced driver-assistance system, using Eyesight-branded stereoscopic cameras; however, the BRZ/GR86 deletes the assisted steering feature to suit the sporty nature of the car.
Special Edition
In 2022, for the 2023 model year, a new Special Edition ("SE") 86 is available in North America. Celebrating ten years since the release of the Scion FR-S in North America, and based on the top-tier Premium trim level, the 86 Special Edition is finished in a unique "Solar Shift" (Orange) exterior paint color, with unique Matte Black-finished eighteen-inch forged aluminum-alloy wheels, black exterior side mirror caps, a black "Duck-Bill" rear spoiler and rear deck (trunk) lid accent bar, and black "C"-pillar stripe decals.
