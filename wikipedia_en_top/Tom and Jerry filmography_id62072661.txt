Tom and Jerry filmography


This is a complete list of the 164 shorts in the Tom and Jerry series produced and released between 1940 and 2014. Of these, 162 are theatrical shorts, one is a made-for-TV short, and one is a 2-minute sketch shown as part of a telethon.
1940–58: Hanna-Barbera/MGM Cartoons
The following 114 cartoons were directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio in Hollywood, California. All cartoons were released to theaters by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Rudolf Ising was the producer of Puss Gets the Boot; subsequent cartoons were produced by Fred Quimby through 1955. Quimby retired in 1955 and from 1955 to 1957, Hanna and Barbera produced the shorts until MGM closed the cartoon studio in 1957, and the last cartoon was released in 1958. Most of these cartoons were produced in the standard Academy ratio (1.37:1). Four cartoons were produced for both Academy Ratio and CinemaScope formats (2.55:1, later 2.35:1). Finally, 19 cartoons were produced in widescreen CinemaScope format only (though reissues have the standard Academy ratio (1.37:1) instead).
Like the other studios, MGM reissued and edited its cartoons when rereleased to theaters. Many pre-1952 cartoons were reissued with Perspecta Sound, which was introduced in 1954. MGM also reissued its cartoons before the introduction of Perspecta Sound. Because of the 1965 MGM vault fire, all original film of pre-September-1951 MGM cartoons are lost, leaving only the backup prints (usually the altered reissue prints), although some production artwork relating to the missing material has survived, like pencil sketches.
1961–62: Gene Deitch/Rembrandt Films cartoons
The following thirteen cartoons were directed by Gene Deitch, produced by William L. Snyder, and animated at Snyder's Rembrandt Films in Prague, Czechoslovakia (now in the Czech Republic, and Slovakia). All cartoons were released to theaters by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
1963–67: Chuck Jones/Sib Tower 12 cartoons
The following 34 cartoons were produced by Chuck Jones in Hollywood, California. Earlier cartoons were produced in conjunction with Walter Bien's "Sib Tower 12 Productions" (one or the other credited on the 1963 and 1964 productions), until it was integrated into a new animation department called MGM Animation/Visual Arts. Directors (if other than Jones) or co-directors for each short are listed. All cartoons were released to theaters by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Note: All the Chuck Jones MGM Tom and Jerry shorts were in Metrocolor.
All were released on DVD in 2009 as part of Tom and Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection.
