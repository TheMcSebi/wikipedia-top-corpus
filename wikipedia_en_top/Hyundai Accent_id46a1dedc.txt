Hyundai Accent
The Hyundai Accent (Korean: 현대 엑센트), or Hyundai Verna (현대 베르나) is a subcompact car produced by Hyundai. In Australia, the first generation models carried over the Hyundai Excel name used by the Accent's predecessor. The Accent was replaced in 2000 by the Hyundai Verna in South Korea, although most international markets, including the US, retained the "Accent" name. The "Accent" name is an abbreviation of Advanced Compact Car of Epoch-making New Technology.
The Accent is produced for the Chinese market by Beijing Hyundai Co., a joint venture with Beijing Automotive Industry Corp. For the Russian market it was assembled by the TagAZ plant in Taganrog until 2011, and since 2011 it is assembled by the HMMR plant in Saint Petersburg and sold under the new name Hyundai Solaris. In Mexico, the Accent was marketed until 2014 by Chrysler as the Dodge Attitude, previously known as the Verna by Dodge. In Venezuela, Chrysler marketed these models as the Dodge Brisa until 2006. The Brisa was assembled by Mitsubishi Motors at its plant in Barcelona, Venezuela. Since 2002, the Accent had been the longest-running small family car sold in North America. In Puerto Rico, it was sold as the Hyundai Brio.
In 2008, Hyundai Accent was named the most dependable subcompact car by J.D. Power and Associates.
First generation (X3; 1994)
The Hyundai Accent (X3) was introduced as a replacement for the Excel in 1994 for the 1995 model year. It continued to be called Dodge Brisa in Venezuela or Hyundai Excel in some markets, such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Indonesia and Australia. In France, it was called the Hyundai Pony, in Indonesia, the pre-facelift model was called as Bimantara Cakra and in China, it was called the Kia Qianlima.
Australia
Australian cars were released in November 1994 available in Sprint and GX trims (three-door liftback) or LX and GLX trims (four-door sedan and five-door liftback). The upper-specification models (GX and GLX) had full cloth interior (as opposed to vinyl seat backings), height and lumbar support adjustments on the driver's seat, four-speaker sound system (instead of two), passenger vanity mirror, a tachometer, and power antenna as standard. GX three-doors also had a standard rear spoiler, while power steering was standard on all but the Sprint. There were also some special editions—the Classique sedan in 1995 and 1996 with anti-lock brakes and the Sportz in 1999 and 2000 with alloy wheels and a rear spoiler. The overwhelming majority sold were the Sprint three-door, enticing buyers with free air-conditioning, driveaway pricing and from late 1998, standard power steering.
The facelift arrived in Australia in April 1997 with accompanying trim changes. The engine was a 1.5-liter G4EK SOHC unit with 91 hp (68 kW). From November 1997 onwards, this was upgraded to a twin cam (DOHC) G4FK version with 74 kW (99 hp) at 6000 rpm and torque of 134 N⋅m (99 lb⋅ft) at 4000 rpm. A double overhead cam (DOHC) engine was also available in America in the Accent GT but made a more-powerful 105 hp (78 kW) at 6000 rpm instead. X3s with the DOHC engine are badged "Twin Cam".
In Australia, the X3 proved so popular (due to its reliability and low price) that it was the third best-selling vehicle in the country in both 1996 and 1998. In the latter year, it achieved more than 44,000 sales (a 5.5% share of the total market), a record figure at the time, for an imported car. Between 1994 and 2000, some 200,000 X3s were sold in Australia, making it arguably the most successful imported vehicle in the country's history.
Romania
In 1998, Hyundai created a joint venture with Romanian manufacturer Dacia to produce the Accent in Romania, at Dacia's Mioveni plant. Unfortunately, the deal failed and Dacia was bought by Renault.
United Kingdom
The Accent was sold in saloon (sedan), liftback, and coupé form in the UK, with a choice of three engines for each: a 1.3 12v (85
 hp), 1.5 12v (92 hp) and a 1.5 16v (105 hp) petrol. There was no diesel option. A GSi spec car was the top-specification Accent. The MVi-spec coupé version won particular praise for its handling agility in the UK. Although the Accent was cheap to buy and insure, its engines were quite thirsty; the 1.5-litre returned 33 mpg‑imp (8.6 L/100 km; 27 mpg‑US) average according to list figures.
United States
In the US, although manuals exist for Accents before and after 1999, a manual for 1999 Hyundai Accent has not been published. Additionally, owners of the 1999 model were informed by their dealers that the power output of the 1.5-liter engine was in fact rated at 88 horsepower (66 kW). Only the 3-door Liftback and 4-door sedan were offered.
Indonesia
In Indonesia, the Accent was assembled locally and marketed as the Bimantara Cakra from 1996 to 1998(alongside the Bimantara Nenggala/Hyundai Elantra) and only available as 4-door sedan with a fuel injected 1.5-liter 12-valve engine and 5-speed manual transmission. After the 1997 Asian financial crisis that affected Indonesia in 1998, Bimantara went bankrupt and the production facilities was taken over by Hyundai (also the first time Hyundai started selling their cars with their own brand in Indonesia) and reintroduced the Cakra as Accent, still with the 1.5-liter 12-valve engine but with the facelifted model and additional 4-speed automatic transmission variant from 1998 to 2001. From 2001 to 2006, this generation was still on sale side by side with the second generation Accent (sold as Hyundai Verna) but as Hyundai Excel, specially for taxi fleets.
China
In China, the Hyundai Excel was branded as the Kia Qianlima under Dongfeng Yueda Kia. It came with either a 1.3-liter SOHC engine or a 1.6-liter engine DOHC engine. Production ran from December 2002 until November 2006. It had similar styling to the regular Hyundai Excel until it was given a facelift in 2005 featuring a new grille and foglamps. Trim levels included the 1.3 DLX, 1.3L GL (Manual), 1.3L GL (Automatic), 1.6 GLS (Manual) and the 1.6 GLS (Automatic). The only body style available was the 4-door sedan.
Safety
The 1998 Hyundai Accent was crash-tested by the European New Car Assessment Programme and showed rather poor performance, scoring only 4 points out of 16 for frontal impact, and receiving 2 stars for adult occupants and 2 stars for pedestrians. The passenger compartment became unstable in the crash test. It was determined that there was an unacceptably high risk of chest injury during side impact crash, as a result, the car would not meet the minimum legal requirement in 1999. The Swedish insurance company, Folksam, rates the 1st-gen Accent as one of the safest cars in its weight class.
Second generation (LC; 1999)
The redesigned 1999 Accent (LC) sported a more angular body and increased dimensions. It received a minor facelift in 2003, and was given the model code LC2. When the Accent sedan underwent a 2006 redesign, the liftback continued on sale during 2006 only in Canada, since the liftback skipped the 2006 model year for the United States. But for Korea, it was the first model with the new nameplate: Verna.
The Accent got revised 1.3 and 1.5-litre engines, featuring various improvements to lower noise, vibration, and harshness. A 1.6-litre DOHC 16-valve replaced the 1.5-litre from 2001, with the 1.5 continuing to be available in some markets. This Accent was also the first to get a diesel version, with a 1.5-litre three-cylinder direct injection turbodiesel, which was badged CRDi.
Trim levels were GSi, CDX and MVi: this was standard on most export versions, although some European markets had their own designations with names like Dynamic=Version etc. Some markets used LS and GLS.
Markets
In North America, the Accent was available in GL, GLS and GT trim levels only, with the 1.5-litre engine at first, then the 1.6-litre engine from 2002. The GT version was similar to the MVi version marketed in Europe and Oceania, although the body kit was not as overtly hot hatch styled.
During 2003 in Canada, the liftback was offered as a GS or GSi with a 1.5 L or 1.6 L engine, respectively. In 2004 the GS trim was equipped with the 1.6 L engine.
It was sold in Russia until 2011 as the Hyundai Accent side-by-side with the 3rd generation model which is sold as the Hyundai Verna.
It was launched in India in October 1999 as the "Accent" and was still in production after some minor facelifts; the car was phased out in 2013 for local market. A new variant of the India-made Hyundai Accent. The Accent GLS variant, which now adopts front airbags and ABS to meet the regulations on safety equipment on new vehicles, implies that the Accent could live on until 2017.
The GLS variant also comes with Air conditioning, power windows front and rear, power steering, central locking, Radio-CD-MP3 audio system, and front fog lights. It is the best selling model produce by Hyundai's Chennai plant.  It has been restyled twice – in 2004 and 2010 – and is strapped with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder petrol engine matched to a five-speed manual gearbox.
In Egypt, it still remains on sale as of January 2019.
In Indonesia, it was sold from 2001 to 2012 and marketed in 3 different names. At first it was marketed in a 4-door body style as "Accent Verna" (2001-2007), available with three trim levels, G, GL and GLS. In 2005, a facelifted version based from G trim was sold for taxi fleet as "Excel II". Later from 2007, both Accent Verna and Excel II 4-door sedan was replaced with a 5-door liftback body style, sold as "Avega" until 2012.
Engines
Safety
A pre-2003 model (a three-door liftback) was crash tested by Australian Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) under the rules as adopted by Euro NCAP. It scored 10.76 out of 16 points for frontal offset impact and 10.96 out of 16 in the side impact test.
The same un-restyled model, a four-door sedan had been crash tested by Russian magazine Autoreview in 2005. Test was carried out to the Euro NCAP regulations. Despite the lack of airbags (which are not available in the cheapest version of Accent on the Russian market) it scored 9.9 of 16 for frontal impact.
The 2003 restyled model was tested by ANCAP as well. The three-door liftback scored 9.19 of 16 points for frontal impact and 9.76 out of 16 in the side impact crash test.
Third generation (MC; 2005)
Hyundai introduced a new-generation Accent (MC) at the 2005 New York International Auto Show. A new exterior, larger interior, and CVVT engine are the notable features.
A single trim level, GLS, is available in the US for the sedan. This sedan includes 6 airbags, air conditioning, power steering with tilt, with optional four-wheel disc antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution, and a 6-speaker CD stereo. A premium sport package includes air conditioning, 15-inch alloy wheels, power windows and heated mirrors, and remote power door locks. An automatic transmission is also available.
Hyundai began selling the 3-door hatchback in the United States during the spring 2006 as a 2007 model year vehicle. The 3-door is available in two trims – GS and SE. The GS is equipped much like the GLS sedan, with some equipment deleted for a base price of US$10,415.  The GS also has a retuned steering rack versus the comfort biased GLS sedan. The SE replaces the former Accent GT, offering a sport-tuned suspension (such as "24 percent stiffer front spring rate, an 11 percent stiffer rear spring rate, a larger stabilizer bar (24 mm) and unique strut valving"), B&M manual shifter as standard, 16 in. alloy wheels, and other sporting features, along with available dealer-installed performance parts such as a cold-air intake and suspension stress bar. The SE is sold as the Verna Sport in Korea. The Hyundai Accent SR is exclusive to Canada and only 500 have been made, this version is like the Accent SE, but in addition has the fender flares, front lip, rear lip, and exhaust tip. Also included with the SR version is the Clarion sound system with, 4channel Amplifier with 400 Watts, 7 speaker Audio System, with 10-inch (250 mm) Subwoofer in a custom made box. Dash also has a Carbon Fiber Trim Kit added to it. For the 2010 model year a "Blue" trim level has been introduced for the Accent with a base price of only US$9,970. The Accent Blue is only available as a 3-door hatchback with a manual transmission or Auto, the sole option being air-conditioning which adds $1,000 to the price.
The Accent is presently the third-bestselling subcompact car in the United States, trailing after its rivals the Chevrolet Aveo and Toyota Yaris. In 2010, Forbes named the Accent amongst the ten worst cars for depreciation.
In Europe, this model was heavily promoted by the motoring press, and even Hyundai themselves, as a "stopgap" model – that it was intended merely to plug the gap in Hyundai's range until a brand new small family car was launched in 2007. The new car, the Hyundai i30, replaced both the Accent and the larger Hyundai Elantra. The name change helped to distance the new model from the budget reputation of the Accent, and also to highlight that the new car can truly compete in the small family hatchback sector – something the Accent was slightly too small to do, and the Elantra too large. The Accent continued to be sold in the U.S. in 2008 with an instrument panel overhaul and standard rear cupholders in the SE model.
Engines:
In Mexico, this is marketed as the Dodge Attitude: trim levels are 1.4 GL and 1.6 GLS. Hyundai had no official representation in Mexico, so select Hyundai models were rebranded as Dodges under an agreement with Chrysler's Mexican division.
In India, it is marketed as Hyundai Verna. The previous generation remains in production alongside as a cheaper alternative, marketed as the Hyundai Accent.
In Egypt, this generation is sold as the Hyundai New Accent (1.6 GLS only), and the previous model is still locally produced and sold as the Hyundai Verna (1.6 GL and GLS trims)
In the Philippines, the third generation (MC sedan) was introduced and made available in 2006 exclusively with a 1.5-L D4FA common rail direct injection (CRDi) turbodiesel with VGT with 110 hp (112 PS) and 240 N⋅m (177 lb⋅ft) with a 5-speed manual transmission. A number of units saw action in the taxi industry because of its fuel efficiency coupled with cheaper diesel fuel costs.
In 2008, Hyundai Accent received the lowest number of problems per 100 vehicles among compact multi-activity vehicles in the proprietary J.D. Power and Associates 2008 Vehicle Dependability Study. Study based on responses from over 52,000 original owners of 2005 model-year vehicles, measuring more than 250 models. Proprietary study results are based on experiences and perceptions of owners surveyed in January to April 2008.
Safety
In 2006, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Accent received an Acceptable overall score in the frontal crash test and a Poor overall score for in the side impact test without its optional side airbags. It didn't perform well even when equipped with side airbags, performance of the car's structure is marginal there would likely be injuries to internal organs, ribs and pelvis.
In 2007, 2006 year model of Hyundai Accent had been tested by ANCAP in June 2007. It scored 3 star in the Occupant Protection, and 2 star in Pedestrian Protection Rating.
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) was safety tested by IIHS in 2009
Hybrid
Hyundai debuted a demonstration version of a hybrid (MC/JB) Accent at the 2005 Guangzhou International Automobile Exhibition in Guangzhou, China. It uses a 90 hp (67 kW), 1.4 L engine with continuously variable valve timing and a 16 hp (11.9 kW) electric motor to achieve 44% better fuel economy. Though originally scheduled for production release in the 2006 model year, introduction of the production version has been delayed indefinitely, along with the Kia Rio hybrid.
The hybrid Accent is expected to be introduced at the same time as a hybrid version of the Kia Rio, the Kia twin of the Accent. A concept model of the Kia Rio hybrid was shown at the 2007 Geneva Auto Show.
Fourth generation (RB/RC; 2010)
Hyundai staged the world-premiere of the fourth generation Accent as the Verna at the 2010 Beijing Auto Show.
South Korea
Hyundai released the Korean version of the Accent (RB series) in November 2010. The new model is offered with the same 1.6-liter engine and 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual as the fifth-generation (MD) Elantra. The car reverted to the "Accent" name as used in the X3 series. The hatchback version, called Accent WIT, replaces the Getz/Click in South Korea. Sedan model was discontinued since in late 2018; the hatchback model was in August 2018. It was sold until Hyundai Venue launched in July 2019.
North America
In January 2011, the sedan had its North American debut and the hatchback had its world debut at the Montreal Auto Show.
There is one engine option in North America for the Accent, a 1.6 L with 138 hp (103 kW) and 123 lb/ft of torque (2011 - 2017 models). This engine features the gas direct injection technology (1.6 "GDI"). Also, the head and block are made of aluminum.
Australia
Australia's Accent was released in August 2011 in three grades consisting of Active, Elite, and Premium in either Sedan or Hatch. All were equipped with a 1.6-litre MPi engine mated to a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic, while a 1.6-litre diesel was later added to the Active grade, but dropped shortly after. In 2013, an SR grade was added to replace the Elite and Premium grades and brought in the Gamma 1.6-litre GDi engine to the range. The Active had switched to a 1.4-litre engine and optional CVT to keep costs down due to the discontinuation of the i20 in Australia.
As part of a 2017 upgrade, Hyundai simplified the Accent to just one grade called Sport. The Sport grade combined the SR's 1.6-litre engine, Premium interior materials, mesh-look grille, cruise control, optional 6-speed automatic, and 16" alloy wheels while staying close to the Active's entry price.
As of January 2020, the Accent was removed from the Hyundai Australia website, marking the end of the nameplate's 20 year run with sales reaching a total of 9,963 registered units in its last year on sale.
Russia
In September 2010, Hyundai unveiled its Russian assembly line and presented the Hyundai Solaris, a production-ready local version of the four-door fourth generation Accent. Production commenced in January 2011. For the Russian market, the Accent badge remained reserved for the second generation Accent that had still been produced in Taganrog in the TagAZ plant at that time, while export models are badged as the Accent. The Hyundai Solaris was available with 1.4-litre Gamma (107 hp) and 1.6-litre Gamma (123 hp) petrol engines, with a 6-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission.
In 2014, the Solaris was facelifted. The car got new front fascia and new 6-speed automatic and 6-speed manual gearboxes for 1.6 version.
India

Fifth generation (HC/YC; 2017)
The fifth-generation Accent has been introduced in China as Verna in late 2016. Production began in the same year with sales started around February 2017. In Russia, where it is known as Solaris as well as in some other CIS markets, the car has been available since March 2017. In India, the car was launched in August 2017 as Verna. It went on sale in the United States in December 2017. Like the fourth-generation model, sedan and hatchback body styles are available, with the latter only available in Canada, Mexico and China.


Unlike the previous generations, the fifth-generation Accent is not sold in South Korea due to falling demand; instead the Venue crossover takes its place in 2019. Without supply from South Korea, the Accent was also phased out in Australia, leaving the entry model role to the Venue.
North America
The hatchback version of the fifth-generation Accent is not available in the United States market due to poor sales for its predecessor, while sedan version continued to be offered. The hatchback version is available alongside the sedan in Mexico and Canada only.
All models of the Accent sold in the United States and Canada are powered by the same 1.6-litre GDi four-cylinder gasoline engine as its predecessor, though horsepower is down to 130 hp (132 PS; 97 kW) from the previous rating of 138 hp (140 PS; 103 kW). The base SE features a six-speed manual transmission, while a six-speed automatic transmission is optional. The six-speed automatic transmission is standard on the SEL and Limited models.
Features available for the first time on the Accent include forward collision avoidance alert, a touch-screen infotainment system with optional Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and Hyundai Blue Link, proximity key entry with push-button start, seventeen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, heated dual front bucket seats, and more.
Power output for the 2020 model year onward has been decreased to 120 hp (122 PS; 89 kW), as the engine was replaced with a new Smartstream 1.6-litre DPi engine with continuously variable valve timing and CVT, replacing the geared automatic transmission.
The Accent was discontinued in Canada in the end of 2020 and was indirectly replaced by the Kona and Venue crossovers, after axing only the sedan model in 2019.  The Accent sedan remained available in the United States, while both the sedan and hatchback remained available in Mexico until its discontinuation.
For 2022, the six-speed manual transmission, only offered in the base SE trim level, was discontinued in the United States.
In June 2022, Hyundai announced that the Accent would be discontinued for the 2023 model year, with its status as the entry-level Hyundai being filled by the Venue, whereas the Mexican market will receive the HB20 instead.
India
Codenamed HCi, the Indian-market version was launched in August 2017 as the Verna. Hyundai stated the new Verna is underpinned by the K2 platform that is more rigid than the previous-gen model’s platform, citing improvements in NVH levels, crashworthiness and overall stiffness. At launch, the Indian-market Verna was available with the 1.6-litre petrol and diesel engines carried from the previous generation and in four variants. Some of the main features includes 6 airbags, sunroof, handsfree trunk and front ventilated seats.
The 1.6-litre petrol engine produces 123 PS (121 hp; 90 kW) and 151 N⋅m (15.4 kg⋅m; 111 lb⋅ft) of torque and the 1.6-litre diesel producing 128 PS (126 hp; 94 kW) and 260 N⋅m (26.5 kg⋅m; 192 lb⋅ft) of torque. Both are now mated to 6-speed manual transmissions with an optional 6-speed automatic transmission. In 2018, a 1.4-litre diesel engine option was introduced, producing 89 PS (88 hp; 65 kW) and 220 N⋅m (22.4 kg⋅m; 162 lb⋅ft).
The facelifted model was released in March 2020. The Verna features cosmetic changes which include a refreshed front end, new LED headlamps, new rear bumper, revamped LED taillamps, and new dashboard design. Engine options were totally revamped, introducing three new engines. The base option is a 1.5-litre Smartstream MPi petrol which generates 115 PS (113 hp; 85 kW) and 144 N⋅m (14.7 kg⋅m; 106 lb⋅ft) of peak torque, available with a 6-speed manual and CVT. The 1.0-litre Kappa II turbo petrol churns out 120 PS (118 hp; 88 kW) and 172 N⋅m (17.5 kg⋅m; 127 lb⋅ft) output, paired to a 7-speed DCT. The 1.5-litre U2 CRDi diesel delivers 115 PS (113 hp; 85 kW) and 250 N⋅m (25.5 kg⋅m; 184 lb⋅ft), with transmission options of 6-speed manual and 6-speed automatic.
The HCi Accent/Verna is exported throughout Middle East, Africa, and to the Philippines and Vietnam in knock-down kits. In November 2020, the Verna was released in Chile as the new Accent. Two months later it was released in Peru with the same name, since the original fifth-generation model was not sold in these countries, keeping the previous generation until 2020.
Russia
In late 2017, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing plant in Saint Petersburg started assembling the fifth-generation Solaris. It received renewed engines which are the Kappa 1.4-litre engine producing 100 PS (99 hp; 74 kW) and the 1.6-litre Gamma II engine with 123 PS (121 hp; 90 kW), paired with 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission.

In India, Hyundai is the sole engine supplier for Formula LGB Hyundai, built by the Chain and Sprocket giant LGB. The single make series is promoted at grassroots level acting as a launch pad for future Formula One hopefuls. The Accent engine is supplied in Stock form albeit after some engine control unit modifications.
X3 Excel in Australia
In Australia, the X3 Accent is sold as the Hyundai Excel and is used in the Excel Rally Series, beginning in 2005. There are restrictions on modifications to the vehicle to reduce cost and encourage competition.
Similarly in 2010, a circuit racing competition began in Queensland called Excel Cup and soon after in South Australia called Circuit Excels. The class has since spread to all six states with several hundred race cars built nationally. A single event nationals has been created to bring all six states together for a single race meeting annually. They are the cheapest racing class in Australia based on a production road car.
