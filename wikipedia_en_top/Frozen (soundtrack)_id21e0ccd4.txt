Two editions of the soundtrack were released by Walt Disney Records on November 25, 2013: a single-disc regular edition, and a two-disc digipak deluxe edition, containing original demo recordings of songs and score compositions, unused outtake recordings, and instrumental versions of the film's main songs.

The album debuted at number 18 on the Billboard 200 chart. The soundtrack has topped the Billboard album chart for thirteen non-consecutive weeks, and as of April 2015 has sold 4 million copies in the U.S. The album has been certified triple-Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and peaked at number one on the aforementioned chart, becoming the fourth soundtrack album from an animated film to reach that milestone.
Commercial performance
As of December 11, 2014, the soundtrack for Frozen had had forty-three nonconsecutive weeks on top of Billboard Top Soundtracks. On the US Billboard 200, the album debuted at No. 18, the highest chart position for the soundtrack in an animated film since the 2006 film Cars. It later moved up to No. 10, becoming the tenth soundtrack from an animated film to reach top 10. The soundtrack subsequently moved to No. 4, which is the highest position for an animated film soundtrack since Disney's Pocahontas in 1995. In the week ending January 5, 2014, Frozen reached No. 1, surpassing Beyoncé's self-titled album (which had previously held the No. 1 position for three weeks after its unannounced release in December 2013) to become the fourth animated film soundtrack in history to reach this position. It remained at number one for a second consecutive week, becoming the first theatrical film soundtrack to stay at No. 1 for multiple weeks since Dreamgirls (also featuring Beyoncé) in early 2007, and the first animated film to spend more than one week at No. 1 since Disney's The Lion King in 1994 and 1995. With thirteen non-consecutive weeks at number one, Frozen earned the most weeks at No. 1 for an album since Adele's 21 (24 weeks) and the most weeks at No. 1 for a soundtrack since Titanic in 1998.
Frozen was the fifth best-selling soundtrack album in the US in 2013 with 338,000 copies sold for the year.

The soundtrack reached its 3 million sales mark in the US in July 2014. Nearly half these were digital sales, making the album the best-selling soundtrack in digital history. Frozen was Billboard Year-End number one album of 2014, becoming the sixth soundtrack in history and the first soundtrack to earn this position since Titanic, as well as the second Disney album to reach this position (the first one is the soundtrack to Mary Poppins). It became the second best-selling album of 2014 with 3,527,000 sold for the year. As of April 2015, it had sold 4 million copies in the US.
