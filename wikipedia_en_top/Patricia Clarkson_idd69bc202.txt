Recounting being cast in the part, Clarkson said: "I got the call that every actor lives for. “Patty, Martin Scorsese is thinking of casting you in his new movie.” And I do what I call the little “Martin Scorsese dance” around my apartment. I think I was in my underwear or pajamas. It's a call you live for. Then I hear back, “But it’s just one scene.” So then I'm dancing a little lower. Then I hear, “It’s you and Leonardo DiCaprio in a cave,” and then I'm dancing again." The film was a box office hit, and Scorsese's highest-grossing film at the time.
Clarkson subsequently had roles in two independent films: Legendy and Main Street (both 2010), before appearing in two mainstream comedies directed by Will Gluck: Easy A (2010), as the mother of a troubled high school student (Emma Stone), and as the mother of an executive recruiter (Mila Kunis) in Friends with Benefits (2011).

The same year, she starred opposite Ben Kingsley in the comedy-drama film Learning to Drive, portraying Wendy, a depressed middle-aged New York book critic learning to drive from a Sikh man. John Patterson of The Guardian praised her performance, writing: "Clarkson gives us every ounce of Wendy’s desperation and self-loathing, and every shade of them as well. She has always been a miraculous performer." The same year, she appeared as villain Ava Paige in the major box-office hit The Maze Runner, a dystopian film based on the 2009 young adult novel. She subsequently reprised the role in both sequels: Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials (2015), and Maze Runner: The Death Cure (2018).
