The Olympic Committee of Israel confirmed a team of 47 athletes, 22 men and 25 women, to compete across 17 sports at the Games. Breaking its previous record of 43 athletes set in 2008, it was the nation's largest ever delegation sent to the Olympics, until the record was again broken by the 90 athletes delegation to the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Among the sports represented by its athletes, Israel marked its Olympic debut in golf (new to the 2016 Games), mountain biking, and triathlon, as well as its return to road cycling, taekwondo, weightlifting, and wrestling after long years of absence.

According to Zilberman, his ambition is "to win a medal at the European or World Championships or the Olympic Games." When it comes to his Olympic training regimen, he said "training under my parents is hard because on the court, they are always trying to push me to my limit." Zilberman's win was Israel's first badminton win at the Olympics. He lost to Chou Tien-chen, and Chou's victory over Yuhan Tan eliminated Zilberman from competition.
Cycling
Road
Israel qualified one rider in the women's Olympic road race, Shani Bloch, by virtue of a top-22 international finish in the 2016 Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) World Rankings, signifying the nation's Olympic comeback to the sport for the first time since 1960. Bloch had retired in 2004 to start a family, but came out of retirement in 2014, training with her Israeli teammates to qualify for Rio. She was the oldest member of the Rio delegation at the age of 37. On finishing, the race Bloch said "I’m so happy that I managed to finish the race. This gives me an amazing sense of satisfaction.

Due to Israel's inexperience representing golf athletes, Beck was required to procure all of her equipment to prepare for Rio, such as her uniform and hats. Israel's Olympic committee reimbursed her for the equipment.  On the topic of representing Israel at the Olympics, Beck said "I think it's because of what my grandparents had to go through, not just my grandparents but everyone during World War II, all the Jewish people during World War II and the holocaust, that obviously brings me anger, but i think what i'm trying to do is bring the anger and try to do something meaningful." Beck finished tied for 31st with a score of two over par. Her best round was the third round, where she was tied for 13th place.
Gymnastics

Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I can do about it. You need to know how to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and wanted to have a good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me and I knew I had no chance after that. I never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.

Controversy
Prior to the Olympics, Facebook allowed users to add the Olympic logo and the team flag to their profile pictures, however Israel was not included on this list. The flag was later added to the list, however was not listed alphabetically, and was included at the end of the list.
Prior to the opening ceremony, the Lebanese delegation was assigned to ride on the same bus as the Israeli delegation. The head of the Lebanese team, Salim al-Haj Nicolas, admitted that he demanded that the bus door be closed on the Israeli team, and that the Lebanese demanded that the Israeli athletes not board the bus. Lebanon and Israel have no diplomatic relations. Udi Gal, an Israeli Olympic sailor, said his team ultimately decided to travel separately to avoid an "international and physical incident" but added "How could they let this happen on the eve of the Olympic Games? Isn't this the opposite of what the Olympics represents?"
On 3 August 2016, two days before the start of the Olympics, the International Olympic Committee officially honored the 11 Israelis murdered during the Munich massacre for the first time.
A Saudi Arabian judoka, Joud Fahmy, was accused of forfeiting her match in order to avoid competing against Gili Cohen. Fahmy, Saudi Arabia's news agency Al Arabiya, and the Saudi Olympic delegation have both stated that Fahmy forfeited because she received an injury. However, other media outlets such as Israel Channel 2 reported she was not injured.
Egyptian judoka Islam El Shehaby refused to shake hands with Israeli Or Sasson or to perform the traditional post-match bow (giving only a quick nod), after Sasson defeated El Shehaby in a first-round match in the heaviest weight class on 12 August. During the Games, social media users pressured Shehaby not to arrive to the match because "it would shame Islam." American coach Jimmy Pedro called the Egyptian's behavior "completely dishonorable and totally unsportsmanlike." El Shehaby was sent home early by the IOC and Egypt's Olympic committee for refusing to shake Sasson's hand.
