History
Infosys was founded by seven engineers in Pune, Maharashtra, India. Its initial capital was $250. It was registered as Infosys Consultants Private Limited on 2 July 1981. In 1983, it relocated to Bangalore, Karnataka.
The company changed its name to Infosys Technologies Private Limited in April 1992 and to Infosys Technologies Limited when it became a public limited company in June 1992. It was renamed Infosys Limited in June 2011.
An initial public offering (IPO) was floated in February 1993 with an offer price of ₹95 (equivalent to ₹580 or US$7.30 in 2020) per share against a book value of ₹20 (equivalent to ₹120 or US$1.50 in 2020) per share. The IPO was undersubscribed but it was "bailed out" by US investment bank Morgan Stanley, which picked up a 13% equity stake at the offer price. Its shares were listed in June 1993 with trading opening at ₹145 (equivalent to ₹890 or US$11 in 2020) per share.
Infosys shares were listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in 1999 as American depositary receipts (ADR). It became the first Indian company to be listed on Nasdaq. The share price surged to ₹8,100 (equivalent to ₹30,000 or US$370 in 2020) by 1999, making it the costliest share on the market at the time. At that time, Infosys was among the 20 biggest companies by market capitalization on the Nasdaq. The ADR listing was shifted from Nasdaq to NYSE Euronext to give European investors better access to the company's shares.
On 28 July 2010, then-British Prime Minister David Cameron visited Infosys HQ in Bangalore and addressed Infosys employees.

Controversies
Settlement of tax fraud in the US
In December 2019, the Attorney General of California, Xavier Becerra announced an $800,000 settlement against Infosys and its BPM (business process management) subsidiary. Close to 500 Infosys employees were working in the state on Infosys-sponsored B-1 visas instead of H-1B visas between 2006 and 2017, as per an official post available on the website of State of California.
This misclassification resulted in Infosys avoiding California payroll taxes such as unemployment insurance, disability insurance, and employment training taxes.
Accusation of visa fraud in the US
In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing visa fraud by using B-1 (visitor) visas for work requiring H-1B (work) visas. The allegations were initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal complaint. He subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed and sidelined after speaking out. Although that case was dismissed it, along with another similar case, brought the allegations to the notice of the US authorities – and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a federal grand jury started investigating.
In October 2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with US authorities by paying US$34 million. Infosys refused to admit guilt and stressed that it only agreed to pay the fine to avoid the nuisance of "prolonged litigation". In its statement, the company said "As reflected in the settlement, Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those claims are assertions that remain unproven".
Allegations of financial irregularities
In 2019, whistle blowers alleged irregularities in the company's financial accounting. Internal investigations conducted by the company concluded that the allegations were without merit. External auditors said that Infosys' approach to revenue recognition was in line with IAS 34 regulations.
Malfunctioning income tax, GST and MCA portal
From 2016 onwards, after Infosys took over the contract from Tata Consultancy Services stakeholders complained about malfunctioning and low performance of portals multiple times. The Income Tax portal went down on the due date of multiple tax periods and taxpayers ended up paying late fees and penalties, and the government allowed the extension of due dates because of this.
Chartered accountants and Company secretaries raised issues with MCA portal on due dates.Many companies became liable for additional fees and fines due to non-compliance.This issue is turning opposite to Ease of doing business initiatives of Government of India.
CAs and Tax professionals raised concerns about the flawed GST portal and their inability to rectify these issues.
Government faced severe criticism from CAs,CSs and other stakeholders for its continuous failure to take action against Infosys and alleged that public fund is being heavily mis-utilised.
