Legislative Assembly of Manitoba
The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba (French: Assemblée législative du Manitoba) is the deliberative assembly of the Manitoba Legislature in the Canadian province of Manitoba. Fifty-seven members are elected to this assembly at provincial general elections, all in single-member constituencies with first-past-the-post voting. Bills passed by the Legislative Assembly are given royal assent by the King of Canada in Right of Manitoba, represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba. The Manitoba Legislative Building is located in central Winnipeg.
The Premier of Manitoba is Heather Stefanson and the current Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba is Myrna Driedger; both of whom belong to the Progressive Conservative Party.
Historically, the Legislature of Manitoba had another chamber, the Legislative Council of Manitoba, but this was abolished in 1876, just six years after the province was formed.
