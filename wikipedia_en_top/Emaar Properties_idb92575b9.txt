Emaar Properties
Emaar Properties (Emaar Developments or simply Emaar) is an Emirati multinational real estate development company located in the United Arab Emirates. It is a public joint-stock company, listed on the Dubai Financial Market, and has a valuation of US$15.5 billion as of June 2021. With six business segments and 60 active companies, Emaar has collective presence in 36 markets across the Middle East, North Africa, Asia, Europe and North America.
Emaar Properties Dubai is one of the largest real estate developers in the UAE and is known for various large-scale projects such as developing Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world.
In 2021 and 2022, Emaar generated controversy when their Marassi project on Egypt’s mediterranean coast caused widespread erosion and great environmental damage of nearby beaches. Widespread outrage on social and traditional media has since been directed at the real estate firm, demanding reimbursement and an explanation. Emaar is said to have deviated from the building permits granted by Egyptian authorities to their project, hence creating unforeseen environmental deterioration of the surrounding beaches. Emaar was seen to ignore those concerns and to carry on with their damaging project activities.
History
1997–2005
Emaar Properties was founded and incorporated in 1997 by chairman Mohamed Alabbar. As one of the leading developers in the UAE, Emaar has diversified interests in real estate including both commercial and residential property development, as well as malls and hospitality. The Dubai government initially owned 100 percent of the company while the founding shareholders held 24.3 percent when operations as a public company commenced after the IPO in 2000. The following year, Emaar announced plans to build Dubai Marina. In 2000, Emaar Properties was listed on the Dubai Financial Market and became the first property company to offer shares to foreign nationals. The first phase of the company's developmental projects began in 2001 when Emaar awarded the contract in a joint venture to build three of the six apartment towers.
In 2003, the company revealed its plans for a signature development project, later known as Downtown Dubai. The project consisted of two developments of historical proportions: Burj Khalifa and The Dubai Mall, the world's tallest building and world's largest mall respectively.
Emaar International LLC was established in 2004 and signified Emaar's expansion into foreign markets. The company has ongoing projects in Africa, Asia, North America, and throughout the Middle East. In 2005, Emaar Hotels & Resorts LLC was established in an exclusive deal with Giorgio Armani to launch a collection of luxury hotels in the designer brand's name. Also in 2005, the high-rise Emaar Square Lifestyle Center was built in Istanbul, Turkey on top of the subterranean Emaar Square Shopping Mall. The 14-story mixed-use building provides residential units, amenity spaces, and retail space at the plaza level.
2006–present
The Dubai Mall officially opened in 2008, and Burj Khalifa in 2010. Despite a collapse in the real estate market in 2009, Emaar reported that Burj Khalifa had reached 80 percent occupancy by fall 2012. By 2014, Emaar was holding over $11.4 billion in real estate investments.
In 2009, John Laing Homes, a subsidiary of Emaar Properties which was acquired in 2006, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US Court for the District of Delaware.
In July 2010, American businessman Lionel Lombard filed a lawsuit against Emaar Properties and its Chairman Mohamed Alabbar in a California federal court alleging he was wrongfully imprisoned and tortured because he had spoken up on behalf of Emaar foreign workers. The case was dismissed in November 2010 by Lombard.
In September 2012, Emaar launched the Address BLVD, a luxurious 72 storey hotel and hotel serviced apartment project in Downtown Burj Dubai adjacent to the Dubai Mall.
In 2014, Emaar Properties announced plans to sell shares of its malls and retail business to the public. The IPO is one of the largest in the region since the global financial crisis. Emaar Malls Group became a publicly traded company on the Dubai Financial Market in October 2014. Closing at 3.25 dirhams with approximately 535 million shares traded, the IPO was the largest in Dubai since 2007. Also in 2014, Emaar opened the world's highest observation deck, At the Top, Burj Khalifa SKY. The highest man-made vantage point sits 555 metres up on the 148th floor of Burj Khalifa.
Emaar celebrated the New Year with the world's most watched NYE celebration for 2015. According to Guinness World Records, Emaar won the title of the "Largest LED-Illuminated Façade" on the world's tallest man made structure" during the NYE celebrations. The record-setting display consisted of 70,000 LED panels that flashed coloured lights and projections of the country's leaders and other images on the Burj Khalifa. Emaar reported a 16 percent rise in second-quarter net profit for 2015, and that it has a land bank of over 235 million square metres.

In 2014, The Dubai Mall had over 80 million visitors, of which 40 percent were tourists from outside the region. As an extension to Dubai mall, Emaar has begun to develop a 55-storey residential building called Downtown Views.
Another large development project commissioned by Emaar Properties of the Downtown Dubai area is The Dubai Fountain. The Dubai Fountain is the tallest performing fountain in the world that began operating in the spring of 2009. The length of the fountain spreads out to be twice the length of a football field (275 meters).
Emaar also developed the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa, which opened in 2010. The building is 2,716.5 feet tall with 160 storeys that are primarily for residential purposes. It is named after the Abu Dhabi ruler Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.

Joint Venture phase
In 2005, while the Hyderabad project was ongoing, Emaar entered into a joint venture to handle future projects in India. Emaar India was founded in 2005 as a joint venture of Emaar Properties PJSC with MGF Developments Limited of India, in which Emaar was by far the larger equity partner and MGF was entrusted the operational responsibilities. The joint venture executed several significant projects, such as the 2010 Commonwealth Games Village in Delhi.
In April 2016, Emaar announced that it would separate from its joint venture partner and that the company would be divided vertically. Shortly after the announcement, Emaar filed the demerger scheme in the Delhi High Court, and Shravan Gupta of MGF resigned from his operational positions. Prashant Gupta is the current CEO of the company.
In pursuance of the intended demerger, the company is presently undergoing a restructuring exercise, wherein Emaar has taken control of all the ongoing projects of the company to ensure their completion at the earliest. The company has committed to deliver 11,000 units by end of 2018, beginning with over 3,000 units in 2017 itself.
Future plans
After initiating the demerger and restructuring exercise, the company launched the "True Emaar lifestyle" brand campaign to focus on establishing the brand 'Emaar India'. In future, the company intends to develop its land bank of 6000 acres, with focus on the residential and hospitality sectors. However, at present its focus is on the completion of all its ongoing projects.
In late 2021, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the governments of Dubai and Jammu & Kashmir to facilitate investment into certain marquee projects.
