Historical time offsets
The southern half of Vietnam (Republic of Vietnam) was formerly part of this time zone prior to the national reunification on 30 April 1975, making it one hour ahead of North Vietnam. After 1975, the whole country came under the North Vietnamese time zone, UTC+07:00.
According to Presidential Decree 41/1987, Indonesia's ex-province of Timor Timur used this time zone with neighboring East Nusa Tenggara and other provinces in Lesser Sunda Islands, parts of Kalimantan and Sulawesi until independence as East Timor, which the country changed to UTC+09:00 as official time zone.
