ISKI Spor Kulübü competed in the Regional Amateur Football League in the 1990–91 season and were promoted to the TFF Second League. After promotion, the club's name changed to İstanbul Büyükşehir Belediyesi Spor Kulübü (Turkish for Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Sports Club). The club played in the TFF Second League until 1996, but after the 2006–07 season they were promoted to the Süper Lig. Finishing 12th in the 2007–08 season enabled them to remain in the Süper Lig for the 2007–08 season. In the 2009–10 season, the club finished the season in 6th place. In the 2012–13 season, the club finished 16th and relegated to the TFF First League. But it finished in the TFF First League as champions and made an immediate return to the top level in the 2013–14 season.
In 2014, the club was bought by new owners with ties to the ruling Justice and Development Party. Its name was changed in June 2014 to İstanbul Başakşehir Futbol Kulübü. During the following 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons, the club finished in 4th place.
