As a teenager, he attended multiple schools, the first being Chandler High School. He later transferred to Hamilton High School where he set the Arizona Class 5A record for rushing yards in a game with 367 against Yuma Kofa as a junior in 1999.
As a senior, Suggs was named a Parade high school All-American in 2000, Gatorade Arizona Player of the Year, the No. 1 jumbo athlete in the nation by SuperPrep Magazine, Arizona Player of the Year by USA Today as well as an All-American by USA Today and the 60th-best player in the nation by Sporting News.
In addition to football, Suggs played AAU basketball.

Professional career
Baltimore Ravens
Suggs was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round with the 10th overall pick in the 2003 NFL Draft, becoming one of the youngest defensive players ever drafted at only 20 years old.
2003 season
Suggs enjoyed immediate success as a rookie in 2003 as he tied an NFL record by posting a sack in each of his first four games. He finished the season with 27 tackles (19 solo), 12 sacks (a Ravens franchise rookie record), six forced fumbles, two pass deflections, and one interception, earning him Defensive Rookie of the Year honors while only starting one game that year.
2004 season
In 2004, Suggs was elected to his first Pro Bowl as he recorded 10.5 sacks and 60 tackles (45 solo).
2005 season
In 2005, the Ravens' new defensive co-ordinator Rex Ryan, son of famous defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan, moved Suggs from outside linebacker to defensive end in many of the defensive schemes. In Week 13, Suggs earned AFC Defensive Player of the Week for his game against the Houston Texans. Despite registering a then-career-low eight sacks, Suggs also set new career-highs in tackles with 69 (46 solo) and interceptions with two.
2006 season
In 2006, Suggs was part of the NFL's best overall defense, the unit allowing a league-low 12.6 points per game. He recorded 64 tackles (46 solo), 9.5 sacks, and set a new career-high in pass deflections with eight. After the season, he was voted to the Pro Bowl for the second time. He was a major contributor as the Ravens went 13–3. For the season, Suggs started nine games at right defensive end in the Ravens base 4–3 and seven games at outside linebacker when the Ravens started game in a base 3–4 defense. Suggs earned attention for his flashy playing style, "Suggs evolved into one of the league's best pass-rushers whether he is blitzing as a linebacker or rushing from defensive end with one hand on the ground."
2007 season
The following season in 2007, Suggs made 80 tackles (52 solo) and five sacks, as he and the Ravens plummeted to 5–11. Like the season before, Suggs was a hybrid defensive end/linebacker, playing 50 percent of the defensive snaps at defensive end in the Ravens base 4–3 defense.
2008 season
On February 19, 2008, the Ravens placed the franchise tag on Suggs. He initially filed a grievance because the team had designated him as a LB with the franchise tag rather than a DE, which resulted in a monetary difference of about $800,000. Despite being unhappy with the franchise tag, Suggs reported to off-season mini-camps to practice with the team. On May 13, 2008, he reached an agreement with the team to split the difference in the franchise tag amounts of a LB and a DE and drop his grievance.
In Week 7 of the 2008 NFL season, Suggs intercepted a pass from Chad Pennington of the Miami Dolphins and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown, the first pick six of his professional career. He earned AFC Defensive Player of the Week for his game against Miami. Two weeks later, he intercepted Derek Anderson of the Cleveland Browns for a game-sealing touchdown. At season's end, he was named to his third Pro Bowl after producing 68 tackles (53 solo), two forced fumbles and eight sacks to go along with the two interceptions, a new career-high nine pass break-ups and two touchdowns. During the 2008–09 NFL playoffs, Suggs recorded sacks in all three of the Ravens' post-season games, including two in the AFC Championship against Ben Roethlisberger and the division-winning Pittsburgh Steelers.
On February 18, 2009, he was once again given the Ravens' franchise tag. On July 15, 2009, the Ravens signed him to a 6-year, $62.5 million contract. His bonus money ($33.1 million) made him the highest paid linebacker in NFL history.
2009 season
The 2009 season was not as productive for Suggs as he recorded a career-low in sacks with 4.5. Playing above his normal playing weight, he also missed the first three games of his career due to injury after quarterback Brady Quinn dove at his legs after cornerback Chris Carr intercepted a pass. In the Wild Card Round against the New England Patriots, Suggs sacked and forced a Tom Brady fumble before recovering the ball on the Patriots' opening drive, helping the Ravens ultimately win 33–14.
2010 season
In 2010, Suggs compiled 68 tackles (53 solo), 11.5 sacks, two forced fumbles and two pass deflections. In the playoff win over the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card Round, he made four tackles (all solo) and two sacks. Against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Divisional Round, he recorded six tackles (five solo), a career-high three sacks, and a forced fumble that was recovered and returned for a touchdown by fellow defensive end Cory Redding, but the Ravens would go on to lose 24–31 after squandering a 21–7 halftime lead. He earned a fourth Pro Bowl nomination. He was ranked 40th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.
2011 season – Defensive Player of the Year
2011 saw Suggs have the best season of his career, which started with a Defensive Player of the Week-winning performance against the Steelers. In a 35–7 blowout, Suggs recorded three sacks and two forced fumbles, contributing heavily to the defense's seven turnovers.
Suggs had two more games that season with three sacks, the second on Thanksgiving in a 16–6 win over the NFC's number-two-seeded San Francisco 49ers and the third in a 24–10 win over the Indianapolis Colts. He earned AFC Defensive Player of the Week honors for both performances. He finished the season with career highs in sacks (14) and forced fumbles (7), tied his career high for interceptions (2), and also had 50 total tackles and six passes defended. He was named to his fifth Pro Bowl and first All-Pro first team.
The Ravens entered the playoffs with a 12–4 record and the number-two seed in the AFC. They had their season ended by the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship after a dropped touchdown by Lee Evans and a notorious missed field goal by Billy Cundiff. On February 4, 2012, Suggs was named the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year.
2012 season – Super Bowl XLVII run
During the 2012 offseason, Suggs tore his Achilles tendon allegedly while playing basketball; though Suggs and his agent have claimed that he was hurt while doing conditioning workouts. Owner Steve Bisciotti stated that it was no concern where he hurt it and the Ravens will not try to avoid paying him his contract. Some medical experts believed that Suggs' injury should have forced him to miss the 2012 season, however Suggs claimed he would return by November 2012. On October 20, 2012, Suggs was removed from the physically unable to perform (PUP) list, allowing him to play the next day against the Houston Texans.  Suggs has been the first player in NFL history to recover so quickly from such a serious injury. Suggs' return surprised many, as he finished the game with four tackles (three solo), one pass defended, and one sack, less than five and a half months after having Achilles tendon surgery. He finished the 2012 season with 22 total tackles, two sacks, and four passes defensed in eight games.
Suggs was key in the Ravens win over the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round of the playoffs with two sacks on Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, after which, the Ravens advanced to New England in a rematch of the previous year's AFC Championship Game where they defeated the New England Patriots by a score of 28–13. The win gave Suggs his first ever AFC Championship and his first appearance in the Super Bowl, being Super Bowl XLVII against the San Francisco 49ers. In that game, the Ravens won 34–31, earning Suggs his first Super Bowl ring. He was ranked 56th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.
2013 season
In the 2013 season, Suggs started all 16 games with 80 tackles, a fumble recovery, and ten sacks. Suggs was elected to participate in the Pro Bowl for his sixth such nomination. He was ranked 26th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014.
2014 season
In Weeks 6–8, Suggs had one sack in each game. In Week 7, the sack he recorded on Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan was for a safety, and he recovered a fumble.
From Weeks 10–17, Suggs recorded at least one sack in each game, with the one exception being the Week 16 loss to the Houston Texans. In Week 10, Suggs had 1.5 sacks on Titans rookie quarterback Zach Mettenberger. Two weeks later, in a Monday Night Football matchup against the New Orleans Saints, Suggs accounted for a sack against Saints quarterback Drew Brees. With the hit, Suggs became the 31st player in NFL history to register over 100 sacks, and the first member of the Baltimore Ravens to achieve such a milestone.
In the Ravens' season finale, Suggs recorded a sack, a defended pass and a fumble recovery, all on Browns first-time-starting quarterback Connor Shaw. The Ravens clinched a Wild Card spot in the playoffs that day. Suggs finished the year with 12 sacks, a pass defended, a fumble recovery, and a safety. He and Elvis Dumervil led the league in sacks by a pair with 29.
In the Wild Card Round of the playoffs, Suggs intercepted a pass from Ben Roethlisberger in the fourth quarter. The ball bounced off the hands of running back Ben Tate, the intended receiver on the play, and landed between a diving Suggs's legs. The Ravens won this game 30–17 and moved onto the Divisional Round against the New England Patriots, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions. He was ranked 84th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.
2015 season
In the regular season opener against the Denver Broncos on September 13, 2015, Suggs suffered an achilles injury and left the game. Hours later, an MRI revealed that his achilles was torn, which prematurely ended his 2015 season.
2016 season
In the 2016 season, Suggs appeared in 15 games. He recorded 8.0 sacks, 28 tackles, seven assisted tackles, four passes defended, and three forced fumbles. He led the team in sacks, forced fumbles, tackles-for-loss, and quarterback hits.
2017 season
In the 2017 season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals, Suggs recorded two sacks and forced a fumble off of quarterback Andy Dalton in the third quarter of the 20–0 victory. The fumble, which was recovered by teammate Michael Pierce, occurred in the Ravens' red zone and helped preserve the eventual shutout victory. In Week 2, against the Cleveland Browns, he forced a fumble off DeShone Kizer, which help set up the Ravens' offense on an eventual touchdown scoring drive in the 24–10 victory. In Weeks 11 and 12, he had two sacks in each game, helping the Ravens win back-to-back times against the Green Bay Packers and Houston Texans. On December 19, 2017, Suggs was named to his seventh Pro Bowl.

Personal life
In December 2003, Suggs was charged with felony aggravated assault stemming from a March 2003 incident in Arizona, in which it was alleged that a verbal altercation after a basketball tournament led to Suggs assaulting a man with a piece of reinforcement rod. Apparently the parties had a disagreement during the tournament, and it was claimed that Suggs swung at the victim and broke his nose and cheekbone. In June 2005, however, Suggs was acquitted of the charges, with a juror commenting that guilt beyond a reasonable doubt was not established.
A series of allegations were made by his girlfriend, Candace Williams; in 2009 she alleged he threw a soap dispenser at her head, struck her in the chest with his hand and held a bottle of bleach over her and their 1-year-old son. No criminal charges were filed against Suggs, however, and Williams' subsequent lawsuit was dismissed. In September 2012, he was accused of punching and dragging his girlfriend Candace Williams beside his car while his two children were inside.  A temporary protective order was placed against Suggs, who was required to surrender his seven firearms, which included an AK-47, and a judge dismissed the order on December 12. Despite Suggs's rocky relationship with Williams, the two married on December 14, 2012, and the protective order was removed. The couple have two children together. His wife filed for divorce in 2015.
Suggs guest starred in Season 2 of the popular HBO series Ballers.
Suggs is Jewish through his paternal grandfather. He has had a Jewish star tattooed on his right arm since 2009, which he says he got "to remind me of who I am," and wears a Star of David necklace. Suggs wore a Star of David on his cleats during a game in October 2019 to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the deadly Tree of Life – Or L'Simcha Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh.
Suggs is the second cousin of Larry Suggs, the father of Orlando Magic player Jalen Suggs.
