Hamilton–Jacobi equation
In physics, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation, named after William Rowan Hamilton and Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, is an alternative formulation of classical mechanics, equivalent to other formulations such as Newton's laws of motion, Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics. The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is particularly useful in identifying conserved quantities for mechanical systems, which may be possible even when the mechanical problem itself cannot be solved completely.
The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is also the only formulation of mechanics in which the motion of a particle can be represented as a wave.  In this sense, it fulfilled a long-held goal of theoretical physics (dating at least to Johann Bernoulli in the eighteenth century) of finding an analogy between the propagation of light and the motion of a particle.  The wave equation followed by mechanical systems is similar to, but not identical with, Schrödinger's equation, as described below; for this reason, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation is considered the "closest approach" of classical mechanics to quantum mechanics.
In mathematics, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation is a necessary condition describing extremal geometry in generalizations of problems from the calculus of variations. It can be understood as a special case of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation from dynamic programming.

Hamilton's principal function
Definition
Let the Hessian matrix $MATH$ be invertible. The relation
shows that the Euler–Lagrange equations form a $MATH$ system of second-order ordinary differential equations. Inverting the matrix $MATH$ transforms this system into
Let a time instant $MATH$ and a point $MATH$ in the configuration space be fixed. The existence and uniqueness theorems guarantee that, for every $MATH$ the initial value problem with the conditions $MATH$ and $MATH$ has a locally unique solution $MATH$ Additionally, let there be a sufficiently small time interval $MATH$ such that extremals with different initial velocities $MATH$ would not intersect in $MATH$ The latter means that, for any $MATH$ and any $MATH$ there can be at most one extremal $MATH$ for which $MATH$ and $MATH$ Substituting $MATH$ into the action functional results in the Hamilton's principal function (HPF)

where
Formula for the momenta: pi(q,t) = ∂S/∂qi
The momenta are defined as the quantities $MATH$ This section shows that the dependency of $MATH$ on $MATH$ disappears, once the HPF is known.
Indeed, let a time instant $MATH$ and a point $MATH$ in the configuration space be fixed. For every time instant $MATH$ and a point $MATH$ let $MATH$ be the (unique) extremal from the definition of the Hamilton's principal function $MATH$ Call $MATH$ the velocity at $MATH$. Then
$MATH$
While the proof below assumes the configuration space to be an open subset of $MATH$ the underlying technique applies equally to arbitrary spaces. In the context of this proof, the calligraphic letter $MATH$ denotes the action functional, and the italic $MATH$ the Hamilton's principal function.
Step 1. Let $MATH$ be a path in the configuration space, and $MATH$ a vector field along $MATH$. (For each $MATH$ the vector $MATH$ is called perturbation, infinitesimal variation or virtual displacement of the mechanical system at the point $MATH$). Recall that the variation $MATH$ of the action $MATH$ at the point $MATH$ in the direction $MATH$ is given by the formula
where one should substitute $MATH$ and $MATH$ after calculating the partial derivatives on the right-hand side. (This formula follows from the definition of Gateaux derivative via integration by parts).
Assume that $MATH$ is an extremal. Since $MATH$ now satisfies the Euler–Lagrange equations, the integral term vanishes. If $MATH$'s starting point $MATH$ is fixed, then, by the same logic that was used to derive the Euler–Lagrange equations, $MATH$ Thus,
Step 2. Let $MATH$ ;\mathbf {q} ,\mathbf {q} _{0},t,t_{0})}
  
 be the (unique) extremal from the definition of HPF, $MATH$ a vector field along $MATH$ and $MATH$ ;\mathbf {q} _{\varepsilon },\mathbf {q} _{0},t,t_{0})}
  
 a variation of $MATH$ "compatible" with $MATH$ In precise terms, $MATH$
$MATH$ $MATH$
By definition of HPF and Gateaux derivative,
Here, we took into account that $MATH$ and dropped $MATH$ for compactness.
Step 3. We now substitute $MATH$ and $MATH$ into the expression for $MATH$ from Step 1 and compare the result with the formula derived in Step 2. The fact that, for $MATH$ the vector field $MATH$ was chosen arbitrarily completes the proof.
Mathematical formulation
Given the Hamiltonian $MATH$ of a mechanical system, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation is a first-order, non-linear partial differential equation for the Hamilton's principal function $MATH$,
$MATH$
For an extremal $MATH$ where $MATH$ is the initial speed (see discussion preceding the definition of HPF),
From the formula for $MATH$ and the coordinate-based definition of the Hamiltonian
with $MATH$ satisfying the (uniquely solvable for $MATH$ equation $MATH$ obtain
where $MATH$ and $MATH$
Alternatively, as described below, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation may be derived from Hamiltonian mechanics by treating $MATH$ as the generating function for a canonical transformation of the classical Hamiltonian
The conjugate momenta correspond to the first derivatives of $MATH$ with respect to the generalized coordinates
As a solution to the Hamilton–Jacobi equation, the principal function contains $MATH$ undetermined constants, the first $MATH$ of them denoted as $MATH$, and the last one coming from the integration of $MATH$.
The relationship between $MATH$ and $MATH$ then describes the orbit in phase space in terms of these constants of motion. Furthermore, the quantities
are also constants of motion, and these equations can be inverted to find $MATH$ as a function of all the $MATH$ and $MATH$ constants and time.
Comparison with other formulations of mechanics
The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is a single, first-order partial differential equation for the function  of the $MATH$ generalized coordinates $MATH$ and the time $MATH$. The generalized momenta do not appear, except as derivatives of $MATH$.  Remarkably, the function $MATH$ is equal to the classical action.
For comparison, in the equivalent Euler–Lagrange equations of motion of Lagrangian mechanics, the conjugate momenta also do not appear; however, those equations are a system of $MATH$, generally second-order equations for the time evolution of the generalized coordinates. Similarly, Hamilton's equations of motion are another system of 2N first-order equations for the time evolution of the generalized coordinates and their conjugate momenta $MATH$.
Since the HJE is an equivalent expression of an integral minimization problem such as Hamilton's principle, the HJE can be useful in other problems of the calculus of variations and, more generally,  in other branches of mathematics and physics, such as dynamical systems, symplectic geometry and quantum chaos.  For example, the Hamilton–Jacobi equations can be used to determine the geodesics on a Riemannian manifold, an important variational problem in Riemannian geometry.
Derivation using a canonical transformation
Any canonical transformation involving a type-2 generating function $MATH$ leads to the relations
and Hamilton's equations in terms of the new variables $MATH$ and new Hamiltonian $MATH$ have the same form:
To derive the HJE, a generating function $MATH$ is chosen in such a way that, it will make the new Hamiltonian $MATH$. Hence, all its derivatives are also zero, and the transformed Hamilton's equations become trivial
so the new generalized coordinates and momenta are constants of motion.  As they are constants, in this context the new generalized momenta $MATH$ are usually denoted $MATH$, i.e. $MATH$ and the new generalized coordinates $MATH$ are typically denoted as $MATH$, so $MATH$.
Setting the generating function equal to Hamilton's principal function, plus an arbitrary constant $MATH$:
the HJE automatically arises
When solved for $MATH$, these also give us the useful equations
or written in components for clarity
Ideally, these N equations can be inverted to find the original generalized coordinates $MATH$ as a function of the constants $MATH$ and $MATH$, thus solving the original problem.
Action and Hamilton's functions
Hamilton's principal function S and classical function H are both closely related to action. The total differential of $MATH$ is:
so the time derivative of S is
Therefore,
so S is actually the classical action plus an undetermined constant.
When H does not explicitly depend on time,
in this case W is the same as abbreviated action.
Separation of variables
The HJE is most useful when it can be solved via additive separation of variables, which directly identifies constants of motion.  For example, the time t can be separated if the Hamiltonian does not depend on time explicitly.  In that case, the time derivative $MATH$ in the HJE must be a constant, usually denoted ($MATH$), giving the separated solution
where the time-independent function $MATH$ is sometimes called Hamilton's characteristic function. The reduced Hamilton–Jacobi equation can then be written
To illustrate separability for other variables, a certain generalized coordinate $MATH$ and its derivative $MATH$ are assumed to appear together as a single function
in the Hamiltonian
In that case, the function S can be partitioned into two functions, one that depends only on qk and another that depends only on the remaining generalized coordinates
Substitution of these formulae into the Hamilton–Jacobi equation shows that the function ψ must be a constant (denoted here as $MATH$), yielding a first-order ordinary differential equation for $MATH$
In fortunate cases, the function $MATH$ can be separated completely into $MATH$ functions $MATH$
In such a case, the problem devolves to $MATH$ ordinary differential equations.
The separability of S depends both on the Hamiltonian and on the choice of generalized coordinates.  For orthogonal coordinates and Hamiltonians that have no time dependence and are quadratic in the generalized momenta, $MATH$ will be completely separable if the potential energy is additively separable in each coordinate, where the potential energy term for each coordinate is multiplied by the coordinate-dependent factor in the corresponding momentum term of the Hamiltonian (the Staeckel conditions).  For illustration, several examples in orthogonal coordinates are worked in the next sections.
Spherical coordinates
In spherical coordinates the Hamiltonian of a free particle moving in a conservative potential U can be written
The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is completely separable in these coordinates provided that there exist functions: $MATH$ such that $MATH$ can be written in the analogous form
Substitution of the completely separated solution
into the HJE yields
This equation may be solved by successive integrations of ordinary differential equations, beginning with the equation for $MATH$
where $MATH$ is a constant of the motion that eliminates the $MATH$ dependence from the Hamilton–Jacobi equation
The next ordinary differential equation involves the $MATH$ generalized coordinate
where $MATH$ is again a constant of the motion that eliminates the $MATH$ dependence and reduces the HJE to the final ordinary differential equation
whose integration completes the solution for $MATH$.
Elliptic cylindrical coordinates
The Hamiltonian in elliptic cylindrical coordinates can be written
where the foci of the ellipses are located at $MATH$ on the $MATH$-axis.  The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is completely separable in these coordinates provided that $MATH$ has an analogous form
where : $MATH$, $MATH$ and $MATH$ are arbitrary functions.  Substitution of the completely separated solution
Separating the first ordinary differential equation
yields the reduced Hamilton–Jacobi equation (after re-arrangement and multiplication of both sides by the denominator)
which itself may be separated into two independent ordinary differential equations
that, when solved, provide a complete solution for $MATH$.
Parabolic cylindrical coordinates
The Hamiltonian in parabolic cylindrical coordinates can be written
The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is completely separable in these coordinates provided that $MATH$ has an analogous form
where $MATH$, $MATH$, and $MATH$ are arbitrary functions. Substitution of the completely separated solution
into the HJE yields
Separating the first ordinary differential equation
yields the reduced Hamilton–Jacobi equation (after re-arrangement and multiplication of both sides by the denominator)
which itself may be separated into two independent ordinary differential equations
that, when solved, provide a complete solution for $MATH$.
Waves and particles
Optical wave fronts and trajectories
The HJE establishes a duality between trajectories and wave fronts. For example, in geometrical optics, light can be considered either as “rays” or waves. The wave front can be defined as the surface $MATH$ that the light emitted at time $MATH$ has reached at time $MATH$. Light rays and wave fronts are dual: if one is known, the other can be deduced.


More precisely, geometrical optics is a variational problem where the “action” is the travel time $MATH$ along a path,
 where $MATH$ is the medium's index of refraction and $MATH$ is an infinitesimal arc length. From the above formulation, one can compute the ray paths using the Euler–Lagrange formulation; alternatively, one can compute the wave fronts by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi equation. Knowing one leads to knowing the other.
The above duality is very general and applies to all systems that derive from a variational principle: either compute the trajectories using Euler–Lagrange equations or the wave fronts by using Hamilton–Jacobi equation.


The wave front at time $MATH$, for a system initially at $MATH$ at time $MATH$, is defined as the collection of points $MATH$ such that $MATH$. If $MATH$ is known, the momentum is immediately deduced.


Once $MATH$ is known, tangents to the trajectories $MATH$ are computed by solving the equation
for $MATH$, where $MATH$ is the Lagrangian. The trajectories are then recovered from the knowledge of $MATH$.
Relationship to the Schrödinger equation
The isosurfaces of the function $MATH$ can be determined at any time t.  The motion of an $MATH$-isosurface as a function of time is defined by the motions of the particles beginning at the points $MATH$ on the isosurface.  The motion of such an isosurface can be thought of as a wave moving through $MATH$-space, although it does not obey the wave equation exactly.  To show this, let S represent the phase of a wave
where $MATH$ is a constant (Planck's constant) introduced to make the exponential argument dimensionless; changes in the amplitude of the wave can be represented by having $MATH$ be a complex number.  The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is then rewritten as
which is the Schrödinger equation.
Conversely, starting with the Schrödinger equation and our ansatz for $MATH$, it can be deduced that
The classical limit ($MATH$) of the Schrödinger equation above becomes identical to the following variant of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation,
