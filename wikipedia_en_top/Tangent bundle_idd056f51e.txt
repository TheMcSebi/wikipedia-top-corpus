Tangent bundle
In differential geometry, the tangent bundle of a differentiable manifold $MATH$ is a manifold $MATH$ which assembles all the tangent vectors in $MATH$. As a set, it is given by the disjoint union of the tangent spaces of $MATH$.  That is,
where $MATH$ denotes the tangent space to $MATH$ at the point $MATH$.  So, an element of $MATH$ can be thought of as a pair $MATH$, where $MATH$ is a point in $MATH$ and $MATH$ is a tangent vector to $MATH$ at $MATH$.
There is a natural projection
defined by $MATH$.  This projection maps each element of the tangent space $MATH$ to the single point $MATH$.
The tangent bundle comes equipped with a natural topology (described in a section below). With this topology, the tangent bundle to a manifold is the prototypical example of a vector bundle (which is a fiber bundle whose fibers are vector spaces).  A section of $MATH$ is a vector field on $MATH$, and the dual bundle to $MATH$ is the cotangent bundle, which is the disjoint union of the cotangent spaces of $MATH$.  By definition, a manifold $MATH$ is parallelizable if and only if the tangent bundle is trivial. By definition, a manifold $MATH$ is framed if and only if the tangent bundle $MATH$ is stably trivial, meaning that for some trivial bundle $MATH$ the Whitney sum $MATH$ is trivial.  For example, the n-dimensional sphere Sn is framed for all n, but parallelizable only for n = 1, 3, 7 (by results of Bott-Milnor and Kervaire).
Role
One of the main roles of the tangent bundle is to provide a domain and range for the derivative of a smooth function.  Namely, if $MATH$ is a smooth function, with $MATH$ and $MATH$ smooth manifolds, its derivative is a smooth function $MATH$.
Topology and smooth structure
The tangent bundle comes equipped with a natural topology (not the disjoint union topology) and smooth structure so as to make it into a manifold in its own right. The dimension of $MATH$ is twice the dimension of $MATH$.
Each tangent space of an n-dimensional manifold is an n-dimensional vector space. If $MATH$ is an open contractible subset of  $MATH$, then there is a diffeomorphism $MATH$ which restricts to a linear isomorphism from each tangent space $MATH$ to $MATH$. As a manifold, however, $MATH$ is not always diffeomorphic to the product manifold $MATH$. When it is of the form $MATH$, then the tangent bundle is said to be trivial. Trivial tangent bundles usually occur for manifolds equipped with a 'compatible group structure'; for instance, in the case where the manifold is a Lie group. The tangent bundle of the unit circle is trivial because it is a Lie group (under multiplication and its natural differential structure). It is not true however that all spaces with trivial tangent bundles are Lie groups; manifolds which have a trivial tangent bundle are called parallelizable. Just as manifolds are locally modeled on Euclidean space, tangent bundles are locally modeled on $MATH$, where $MATH$ is an open subset of Euclidean space.
If  M is a smooth n-dimensional manifold, then it comes equipped with an atlas of charts $MATH$, where $MATH$ is an open set in $MATH$ and
is a diffeomorphism. These local coordinates on $MATH$ give rise to an isomorphism $MATH$ for all $MATH$. We may then define a map
by
We use these maps to define the topology and smooth structure on $MATH$. A subset $MATH$ of $MATH$ is open if and only if
is open in $MATH$ for each $MATH$ These maps are homeomorphisms between open subsets of $MATH$ and $MATH$ and therefore serve as charts for the smooth structure on $MATH$. The transition functions on chart overlaps $MATH$ are induced by the Jacobian matrices of the associated coordinate transformation and are therefore smooth maps between open subsets of $MATH$.
The tangent bundle is an example of a more general construction called a vector bundle (which is itself a specific kind of fiber bundle). Explicitly, the tangent bundle to an $MATH$-dimensional manifold $MATH$ may be defined as a rank $MATH$ vector bundle over $MATH$ whose transition functions are given by the Jacobian of the associated coordinate transformations.
Examples
The simplest example is that of $MATH$. In this case the tangent bundle is trivial: each $MATH$ is canonically isomorphic to $MATH$ via the map $MATH$ which subtracts $MATH$, giving a diffeomorphism $MATH$.
Another simple example is the unit circle, $MATH$ (see picture above). The tangent bundle of the circle is also trivial and isomorphic to $MATH$. Geometrically, this is a cylinder of infinite height.
The only tangent bundles that can be readily visualized are those of the real line $MATH$ and the unit circle $MATH$, both of which are trivial. For 2-dimensional manifolds the tangent bundle is 4-dimensional and hence difficult to visualize.
A simple example of a nontrivial tangent bundle is that of the unit sphere $MATH$: this tangent bundle is nontrivial as a consequence of the hairy ball theorem. Therefore, the sphere is not parallelizable.
Vector fields
A smooth assignment of a tangent vector to each point of a manifold is called a vector field. Specifically, a vector field on a manifold $MATH$ is a smooth map
such that $MATH$ with $MATH$ for every $MATH$. In the language of fiber bundles, such a map is called a section. A vector field on $MATH$ is therefore a section of the tangent bundle of $MATH$.
The set of all vector fields on $MATH$ is denoted by $MATH$. Vector fields can be added together pointwise
and multiplied by smooth functions on M
to get other vector fields. The set of all vector fields $MATH$ then takes on the structure of a module over the commutative algebra of smooth functions on M, denoted $MATH$.
A local vector field on $MATH$ is a local section of the tangent bundle. That is, a local vector field is defined only on some open set $MATH$ and assigns to each point of $MATH$ a vector in the associated tangent space. The set of local vector fields on $MATH$ forms a structure known as a sheaf of real vector spaces on $MATH$.
The above construction applies equally well to the cotangent bundle – the differential 1-forms on $MATH$ are precisely the sections of the cotangent bundle $MATH$, $MATH$ that associate to each point $MATH$ a 1-covector $MATH$, which map tangent vectors to real numbers:  $MATH$. Equivalently, a differential 1-form $MATH$ maps a smooth vector field $MATH$ to a smooth function $MATH$.
Higher-order tangent bundles
Since the tangent bundle $MATH$ is itself a smooth manifold, the second-order tangent bundle can be defined via repeated application of the tangent bundle construction:
In general, the $MATH$th order tangent bundle $MATH$ can be defined recursively as $MATH$.
A smooth map $MATH$ has an induced derivative, for which the tangent bundle is the appropriate domain and range $MATH$.  Similarly, higher-order tangent bundles provide the domain and range for higher-order derivatives $MATH$.
A distinct but related construction are the jet bundles on a manifold, which are bundles consisting of jets.
Canonical vector field on tangent bundle
On every tangent bundle $MATH$, considered as a manifold itself, one can define a canonical vector field $MATH$ as the diagonal map on the tangent space at each point. This is possible because the tangent space of a vector space W is naturally a product, $MATH$ since the vector space itself is flat, and thus has a natural diagonal map $MATH$ given by $MATH$ under this product structure. Applying this product structure to the tangent space at each point and globalizing yields the canonical vector field. Informally, although the manifold $MATH$ is curved, each tangent space at a point $MATH$, $MATH$, is flat, so the tangent bundle manifold $MATH$ is locally a product of a curved $MATH$ and a flat $MATH$ Thus the tangent bundle of the tangent bundle is locally (using $MATH$ for "choice of coordinates" and $MATH$ for "natural identification"):
and the map $MATH$ is the projection onto the first coordinates:
Splitting the first map via the zero section and the second map by the diagonal yields the canonical vector field.
If $MATH$ are local coordinates for $MATH$, the vector field has the expression
More concisely, $MATH$ – the first pair of coordinates do not change because it is the section of a bundle and these are just the point in the base space: the last pair of coordinates are the section itself. This expression for the vector field depends only on $MATH$, not on $MATH$, as only the tangent directions can be naturally identified.
Alternatively, consider the scalar multiplication function:
The derivative of this function with respect to the variable $MATH$ at time $MATH$ is a function $MATH$, which is an alternative description of the canonical vector field.
The existence of such a vector field on $MATH$ is analogous to the canonical one-form on the cotangent bundle. Sometimes $MATH$ is also called the Liouville vector field, or radial vector field. Using $MATH$ one can characterize the tangent bundle. Essentially, $MATH$ can be characterized using 4 axioms, and if a manifold has a vector field satisfying these axioms, then the manifold is a tangent bundle and the vector field is the canonical vector field on it. See for example, De León et al.
Lifts
There are various ways to lift objects on $MATH$ into objects on $MATH$. For example,  if $MATH$ is a curve in $MATH$, then $MATH$ (the tangent of $MATH$)  is a curve in $MATH$. In contrast, without further assumptions on $MATH$ (say, a Riemannian metric), there is no similar lift into the cotangent bundle.
The vertical lift of a function $MATH$ is the function $MATH$ defined by $MATH$, where $MATH$ is the canonical projection.
