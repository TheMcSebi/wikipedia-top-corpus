Hölder's inequality
In mathematical analysis, Hölder's inequality, named after Otto Hölder, is a fundamental inequality between integrals and an indispensable tool for the study of Lp spaces.
The numbers p and q above are said to be Hölder conjugates of each other. The special case p = q = 2 gives a form of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. Hölder's inequality holds even if ||fg||1 is infinite, the right-hand side also being infinite in that case. Conversely, if f is in Lp(μ) and g is in Lq(μ), then the pointwise product fg is in L1(μ).
Hölder's inequality is used to prove the Minkowski inequality, which is the triangle inequality in the space Lp(μ), and also to establish that Lq(μ) is the dual space of Lp(μ) for p ∈ [1, ∞).
Hölder's inequality was first found by Leonard James Rogers (1888). Inspired by Rogers' work, Hölder (1889) gave another proof as part of a work developing the concept of convex and concave functions and introducing Jensen's inequality, which was in turn named for work of Johan Jensen building on Hölder's work.

Conventions
The brief statement of Hölder's inequality uses some conventions.
Estimates for integrable products
As above, let f and g denote measurable real- or complex-valued functions defined on S. If ||fg||1 is finite, then the pointwise products of f with g and its complex conjugate function are μ-integrable, the estimate
and the similar one for fg hold, and Hölder's inequality can be applied to the right-hand side. In particular, if f and g are in the Hilbert space L2(μ), then Hölder's inequality for p = q = 2 implies
where the angle brackets refer to the inner product of L2(μ). This is also called Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, but requires for its statement that ||f ||2 and ||g||2 are finite to make sure that the inner product of f and g is well defined. We may recover the original inequality (for the case p = 2) by using the functions |f | and |g| in place of f and g.
Generalization for probability measures
If (S, Σ, μ) is a probability space, then p, q ∈ [1, ∞] just need to satisfy 1/p + 1/q ≤ 1, rather than being Hölder conjugates. A combination of Hölder's inequality and Jensen's inequality implies that
for all measurable real- or complex-valued functions f and g on S.
Notable special cases
For the following cases assume that p and q are in the open interval (1,∞) with 1/p + 1/q = 1.
Counting measure
For the n-dimensional Euclidean space, when the set S is {1, ..., n} with the counting measure, we have
Often the following practical form of this is used, for any $MATH$:
For more than two sums, the following generalisation (Chen (2015)) holds, with real positive exponents   $MATH$ and $MATH$:
Equality holds iff  $MATH$ :|a_{n}|=|b_{1}|:|b_{2}|:\cdots :|b_{n}|=\cdots =|z_{1}|:|z_{2}|:\cdots :|z_{n}|}
  
.
If S = N with the counting measure, then we get Hölder's inequality for sequence spaces:
Lebesgue measure
If S is a measurable subset of Rn with the Lebesgue measure, and f and g are measurable real- or complex-valued functions on S, then Hölder inequality is
Probability measure
For the probability space $MATH$ let $MATH$ denote the expectation operator. For real- or complex-valued random variables $MATH$ and $MATH$ on $MATH$ Hölder's inequality reads
Let $MATH$  and define $MATH$ Then $MATH$ is the Hölder conjugate of $MATH$ Applying Hölder's inequality to the random variables $MATH$ and $MATH$ we obtain
In particular, if the sth absolute moment is finite, then the r th absolute moment is finite, too. (This also follows from Jensen's inequality.)
Product measure
For two σ-finite measure spaces (S1, Σ1, μ1) and (S2, Σ2, μ2) define the product measure space by
where S is the Cartesian product of S1 and S2, the σ-algebra Σ arises as product σ-algebra of Σ1 and Σ2, and μ denotes the product measure of μ1 and μ2. Then Tonelli's theorem allows us to rewrite Hölder's inequality using iterated integrals: If f and g are Σ-measurable real- or complex-valued functions on the Cartesian product S, then
This can be generalized to more than two σ-finite measure spaces.
Vector-valued functions
Let (S, Σ, μ) denote a σ-finite measure space and suppose that f = (f1, ..., fn) and g = (g1, ..., gn) are Σ-measurable functions on S, taking values in the n-dimensional real- or complex Euclidean space. By taking the product with the counting measure on {1, ..., n}, we can rewrite the above product measure version of Hölder's inequality in the form
If the two integrals on the right-hand side are finite, then equality holds if and only if there exist real numbers α, β ≥ 0, not both of them zero, such that
for μ-almost all x in S.
This finite-dimensional version generalizes to functions f and g taking values in a normed space which could be for example a sequence space or an inner product space.
Proof of Hölder's inequality
There are several proofs of Hölder's inequality; the main idea in the following is Young's inequality for products.
If ||f ||p = 0, then f is zero μ-almost everywhere, and the product fg is zero μ-almost everywhere, hence the left-hand side of Hölder's inequality is zero. 
The same is true if ||g||q = 0. 
Therefore, we may assume ||f ||p > 0 and ||g||q > 0 in the following. 
If ||f ||p = ∞ or ||g||q = ∞, then the right-hand side of Hölder's inequality is infinite. 
Therefore, we may assume that ||f ||p and ||g||q are in (0, ∞). 
If p = ∞ and q = 1, then |fg| ≤ ||f ||∞ |g| almost everywhere and Hölder's inequality follows from the monotonicity of the Lebesgue integral. Similarly for p = 1 and q = ∞. 
Therefore, we may assume p, q ∈ (0, 1)  ∪ (1,∞). However, to apply Young's inequality for products, we will require p, q ∈ (1,∞)
Dividing f and g by ||f ||p and ||g||q, respectively, we can assume that
We now use Young's inequality for products, which states that whenever $MATH$ are in (1,∞) with $MATH$
for all nonnegative a and b, where equality is achieved if and only if ap = bq. Hence
Integrating both sides gives
which proves the claim.
Under the assumptions p ∈ (1, ∞) and ||f ||p = ||g||q, equality holds if and only if |f |p = |g|q almost everywhere. 
More generally, if ||f ||p and ||g||q are in (0, ∞), then Hölder's inequality becomes an equality if and only if there exist real numbers α, β > 0, namely
such that
The case ||f ||p = 0 corresponds to β = 0 in (*). The case ||g||q = 0 corresponds to α = 0 in (*).
Alternative proof using Jensen's inequality:
The function $MATH$ on (0,∞) is convex because $MATH$, so by Jensen's inequality, 
where ν is any probability distribution and h any ν-measurable function. Let μ be any measure, and ν the distribution whose density w.r.t. μ is proportional to $MATH$, i.e.
Hence we have, using $MATH$, hence $MATH$, and letting $MATH$,
Finally, we get
This assumes that f, g are real and non-negative, but the extension to complex functions is straightforward (use the modulus of f, g). 
It also assumes that $MATH$ are neither null nor infinity, and that $MATH$: all these assumptions can also be lifted as in the proof above.
Extremal equality
Statement
Assume that 1 ≤ p < ∞ and let q denote the Hölder conjugate. Then for every f ∈ Lp(μ),
where max indicates that there actually is a g maximizing the right-hand side. When p = ∞ and if each set A in the σ-field Σ with μ(A) = ∞ contains a subset B ∈ Σ with 0 < μ(B) < ∞ (which is true in particular when μ is σ-finite), then
Proof of the extremal equality:
By Hölder's inequality, the integrals are well defined and, for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞,
hence the left-hand side is always bounded above by the right-hand side.
Conversely, for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, observe first that the statement is obvious when ||f ||p = 0. Therefore, we assume ||f ||p > 0 in the following.
If 1 ≤ p < ∞, define g on S by
By checking the cases p = 1 and 1 < p < ∞ separately, we see that ||g||q = 1 and
It remains to consider the case p = ∞. For ε ∈ (0, 1) define
Since f is measurable, A ∈ Σ. By the definition of ||f ||∞ as the essential supremum of f and the assumption ||f ||∞ > 0, we have μ(A) > 0. Using the additional assumption on the σ-field Σ if necessary, there exists a subset B ∈ Σ of A with 0 < μ(B) < ∞. Define g on S by
Then g is well-defined, measurable and |g(x)| ≤ 1/μ(B) for x ∈ B, hence ||g||1 ≤ 1. Furthermore,

Generalization of Hölder's inequality
Assume that r ∈ (0, ∞] and p1, ..., pn ∈  (0, ∞] such that
where 1/∞ is interpreted as 0 in this equation.  Then for all measurable real or complex-valued functions f1, ..., fn defined on S,
where we interpret any product with a factor of ∞ as ∞ if all factors are positive, but the product is 0 if any factor is 0.
In particular, if $MATH$ for all $MATH$ then $MATH$
Note: For $MATH$ contrary to the notation, ||.||r is in general not a norm because it doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality.
Proof of the generalization:
We use Hölder's inequality and mathematical induction. If $MATH$ then the result is immediate. Let us now pass from $MATH$ to $MATH$ Without loss of generality assume that $MATH$
Case 1: If $MATH$ then
Pulling out the essential supremum of |fn| and using the induction hypothesis, we get
Case 2: If $MATH$ then necessarily $MATH$ as well, and then

Raising to the power $MATH$ and rewriting,
Since $MATH$ and

Interpolation
Let p1, ..., pn ∈ (0, ∞] and let θ1, ..., θn ∈ (0, 1) denote weights with θ1 + ... + θn = 1. Define $MATH$ as the weighted harmonic mean, that is,
Given measurable real- or complex-valued functions $MATH$ on S, then the above generalization of Hölder's inequality gives
In particular, taking $MATH$ gives
Specifying further θ1 = θ and θ2 = 1-θ, in the case $MATH$ we obtain the interpolation result (Littlewood's inequality)
for $MATH$ and
An application of Hölder gives Lyapunov's inequality: If
then
and in particular
Both Littlewood and Lyapunov imply that if $MATH$ then $MATH$ for all $MATH$


Reverse Hölder inequality
Assume that p ∈ (1, ∞) and that the measure space (S, Σ, μ) satisfies μ(S) > 0. Then for all measurable real- or complex-valued functions f and g on S such that g(s) ≠ 0 for μ-almost all s ∈ S,
If
then the reverse Hölder inequality is an equality if and only if
Note: The expressions:
$MATH$ and $MATH$
are not norms, they are just compact notations for
Note that p and
are Hölder conjugates. 
Application of Hölder's inequality gives
Raising to the power p gives us:
Therefore:
Now we just need to recall our notation.
(Reverse) Hölder inequality with multiple negative norms
The Reverse Hölder inequality (above) can be generalized to the case of multiple functions if all but one conjugate is negative.
That is,
As was proven by Wing-Sum Cheung in 2000
Conditional Hölder inequality
Let (Ω, F, $MATH$) be a probability space, G ⊂ F a sub-σ-algebra, and p, q ∈ (1, ∞) Hölder conjugates, meaning that 1/p + 1/q = 1. Then for all real- or complex-valued random variables X and Y on Ω,
Remarks:
Proof of the conditional Hölder inequality:
Define the random variables
and note that they are measurable with respect to the sub-σ-algebra. Since
it follows that |X| = 0 a.s. on the set {U = 0}. Similarly, |Y| = 0 a.s. on the set {V = 0}, hence
and the conditional Hölder inequality holds on this set. On the set
the right-hand side is infinite and the conditional Hölder inequality holds, too. Dividing by the right-hand side, it therefore remains to show that
This is done by verifying that the inequality holds after integration over an arbitrary
Using the measurability of U, V, 1G with respect to the sub-σ-algebra, the rules for conditional expectations, Hölder's inequality and 1/p + 1/q = 1, we see that
Hölder's inequality for increasing seminorms
Let S be a set and let $MATH$ be the space of all complex-valued functions on S. Let N be an increasing seminorm on $MATH$ meaning that, for all real-valued functions $MATH$ we have the following implication (the seminorm is also allowed to attain the value ∞):
Then:
where the numbers $MATH$ and $MATH$ are Hölder conjugates.
Remark: If (S, Σ, μ) is a measure space and $MATH$ is the upper Lebesgue integral of $MATH$ then the restriction of N to all Σ-measurable functions gives the usual version of Hölder's inequality.


Distances based on Hölder inequality
Hölder inequality can be used to define statistical dissimilarity measures between probability distributions. Those Hölder divergences are projective: They do not depend on the normalization factor of densities.
