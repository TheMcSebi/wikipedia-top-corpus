Drake & Josh
Drake & Josh is an American teen sitcom created by Dan Schneider for Nickelodeon. The series follows two teenage stepbrothers Drake Parker (Drake Bell) and Josh Nichols (Josh Peck) as they live together despite opposite personalities. The series also stars Nancy Sullivan, Jonathan Goldstein, and Miranda Cosgrove.
After actors Bell and Peck previously appeared in The Amanda Show, Schneider decided to create Drake & Josh with them in starring roles. The series aired from January 11, 2004, to September 16, 2007, totaling 57 episodes and 4 seasons. It also had two TV films: Drake & Josh Go Hollywood (2006) and Merry Christmas, Drake & Josh (2008). The series' opening theme song, "I Found a Way", is written by Drake Bell and Backhouse Mike and performed by Bell.
Plot
The series revolves around two teenage stepbrothers, Drake Parker and Josh Nichols, who live in San Diego, California with Drake's younger biological sister Megan and biological mother Audrey, and Josh's biological father Walter. Drake is cool and popular, having his own band and being a ladies' man, yet can be narcissistic and absent-minded, while Josh is an intellectual, clumsy and awkward; yet very loving and caring. Josh ends up working at a local movie theater called The Premiere in the second season of the show, which ends up being a key set location. The two boys are often involved in comedic escapades and challenges while also handling various teenage problems.
Drake and Josh have shown multiple times throughout the series that they care deeply about each other. Drake has helped Josh throughout the series and Josh has helped Drake too. They both worked at a movie theatre together, but Drake takes the blame for an incident Josh created and gets fired as he could see Josh cared about the job more. Drake has taken advantage of Josh and Josh always tries to teach him life lessons. For instance, Josh previously arranged his former camp counselors to teach Drake in the evils of gambling.

Production
Drake Bell and Josh Peck had previously acted together on The Amanda Show, created by Dan Schneider. Bell and Peck's differing personalities inspired Schneider to create a new show starring them as characters with traits similar to their own. An unaired pilot episode featured Stephen Furst as Walter Nichols, although he was busy with another project when Drake & Josh was picked up as a series, and Jonathan Goldstein was cast in the role instead. A house in Los Angeles' Encino neighborhood was used for exterior shots of the family's home, while interior scenes were shot on a sound stage at the Nickelodeon on Sunset studios in Hollywood. As of January 2005, Tribune Studios in Hollywood was also used as a filming location.
Production was suspended in late December 2005, after Bell's injury in a car crash, prior to which he had filmed three episodes of the fourth season. Filming resumed in March 2006. The following month, Nickelodeon greenlit an additional seven episodes for the fourth season, and Bell and Peck also signed on to direct several episodes. With the extended season, filming was now expected to continue through July 2006. According to Schneider, the show ended due to a collective decision from the creative forces behind the show.
The profession of the family's mother and her name are never revealed on the show, although Schneider had written dialogue into the series finale that would have revealed her name as Audrey and her profession as a catering business. The scene was filmed, but Schneider ultimately chose to remove it during editing. Schneider said, "On the one hand, I thought it was funny to finally reveal it, so casually, in the very last episode â€“ there was something ironic about that. But then I decided that, because fans always seemed to have fun trying to figure it out (what 'Mom's' name and job were), it would be better to 'keep the bit going' for eternity, by never revealing it in any episode."

Cancelled revival and Separation
In March 2019, Bell announced that he and Peck were working on a Drake & Josh revival that would feature both of them reprising their roles. The proposed project would have featured similar characters and scenarios in a more adult, comedic way. At the time, Bell and Peck were in discussions with several networks about the project. However, in October 2021, it was reported that the revival had been cancelled, as a result of production delays and Bell's guilty plea to charges of attempted child endangerment.
In March 2022, Bell and his wife Janet stated that the reboot show they had pitched would be called Josh & Drake. Ultimately, the idea was shelved due to creative differences. The show's script was said to have been written by Peck. Janet stated, "Josh wrote Drake as a failed musician and Josh wrote himself as a real estate agent. OK, that's fine, but Drake is a musician in real life, so it wouldn't make sense." Bell added, "I just asked him to change a couple things and he couldn't and my wife wouldn't let me do it."
In July 2022, while on press for his candid memoir "Happy People Are Annoying" Josh Peck revealed on an online interview with the Youtube channel "Life stories By Goalcast", that the podcast episode Drake and  his wife Janet's accusations blaming him for the reboot being cancelled was entirely false and that the real reason why the reboot didn't happen was because of mostly creative differences and the fact that he didn't want to work with Drake Bell due to his previous charges of being a child molester. He also revealed that they were never friends in real life like their characters were on the show as the two went 8 years without seeing or speaking to each other following the show's conclusion. "
