Started as a men's health magazine by Rodale, Inc. in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, the magazine currently covers various men's lifestyle topics such as fitness, nutrition, fashion and sexuality. The magazine's website, MensHealth.com, averages over 118 million page views a month.
History
Started by Mark Bricklin in the US in 1986 as a health magazine, Men's Health evolved into a lifestyle magazine, covering fitness, nutrition, relationships, travel, technology, fashion and finance. Bricklin, Rodale, Inc. editors Larry Stains and Stefan Bechtel produced three newsstand test issues. The results led Rodale to start Men's Health as a quarterly magazine in 1988 and begin to sell subscriptions. 

Bricklin, who was editor-in-chief of Prevention magazine, appointed Michael J. Lafavore (born April 28, 1952) as editor of Men's Health that year. In his 12 years as editor-in-chief, Mike Lafavore increased the circulation from 100,000 to over 1.5 million, increased publication to ten 10 times a year and expanded the magazine to Australia, France, Germany, Mexico, Russia, South Africa and the UK. The South African version, along with Women's Health, is licensed for publication by Media24, with distribution by Magzter.
He created the editorial formula, hired Steven Slon from service journalism and Greg Gutfeld from Prevention. He worked with longtime staff editor Denis Boyles, a former Playboy contributing editor, to develop the magazine's voice. Lafavore left Men's Health in 2000, the same year Capell's Circulation Report named the magazine Circulation Performer of the Decade. He named Gutfeld his successor. After one year, Gutfeld was replaced by David Zinczenko.
Zinczenko became editor-in-chief in 2000. Circulation increased 30 percent, ad pages by 80 percent from 700 to 1150. In 2000, the brand had 21 international editions. In 2001 the title was consistently selling 400,000 copies at newsstands and circulation was 1.6 million. In 2001, the magazine started the annual list of cities with the healthiest men, based on twenty "live-long parameters, including death rates (both homicide and disease); illness rates (high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, etc.); body-mass index; fitness training; even environmental factors like number of parks, golf courses, etc." In 2003, the circulation was 1.7 million. In 2006, the circulation was close to 1.8 million.
Men's Health magazine has been criticized for its focus on physical health, which can increase men's anxieties about their bodies, making them more prone to eating disorders and compulsive over-exercising. The New York Times stated, "Since its debut in the late 1980s, the magazine has surpassed traditional men's books like Esquire and GQ by following the formula of best-selling women's magazines—by catering to men's anxieties about their bodies and sexual performance." Columbia Journalism Review stated the magazine "deals overwhelmingly with self-care and, in fact, exaggerates the possibilities for autonomous personal transformation." Editor-In-Chief Zinczenko argued that the magazine worked toward "overcoming the resistance of the 86-percent male audience to health as a subject" and redefining health as "inclusive of everything that could improve a man's life. Great sex. Great food. Endorphin-boosting exercise. Looking and feeling your best. We turned health into a concept every guy would want to embrace, starting with the healthy guy on the cover."
Men's Health has been criticized for reusing cover taglines. Zinczenko replied that 80 percent of magazine sales are by subscription, and those covers differ from the newsstand version. "Twenty years of Men's Health has certainly produced several lines that have proven themselves effective at newsstand, which makes up about 20 percent of our print run. We plan to keep using the most effective marketing tools to reach the largest market we possibly can." In July 2010, the magazine was criticized for including tiny credit lines on the cover rather than inside as a possible quid-pro-quo for advertisers. Zinczenko said the lines saved readers from having to dig for information and that Men's Health had been including the lines for over a year regardless of advertiser status. A spokesperson for the American Society of Magazine Editors said that no rules were broken. The director for print strategy at a media firm said the mention was "too small of a plug to get brands excited."
In 2004, Men's Health began putting celebrities and athletes on the cover, and with their shirts on—a departure from the covers of the 1990s. In 2004, Rodale filed suit against Men's Fitness for its redesign, "a copycat version—one that is obviously intended to confuse consumers." In May 2006, the magazine published a limited edition color cover of Josh Holloway. In the first half of 2006, newsstand sales for Men's Health rose from 492,000 to 544,000 during a price increase from $3.95 to $4.50. In 2006 Rodale's properties, including Men's Health, tried to increase online content by adding video to each section, telling section editors to write blogs, and hiring an online ad sales director.
In 2008, the magazine partnered with Google to make back issues available. In July 2008, Men's Health became the first to "create the first fully interactive advertising magazine in America," where readers could take a picture of an ad, and a promotional "bounce-back" was sent to their phone. For its 20th anniversary issue in November 2008, Men's Health included an interview and photo shoot with president-elect Barack Obama. In 2010, Obama was again featured about health care and his plans.
In 2009, Men's Health published Belly Off! Diet based on the weight-loss testimonial column in the magazine. The column "Eat This, Not That!" became a book series in 2007, written by Zinczenko and Matt Goulding), and was turned into different versions (children, supermarket, restaurant, diet book) and free iPhone applications. EatThis.MensHealth.com was the most highly trafficked section of MensHealth.com in 2009 with 1 million unique visitors and 15 million page views a month.
Editor-in-chief Matt Bean led the magazine in developing over 40 mobile apps for the iPhone, Android and BlackBerry. "Eat This, Not That! The Game" won an American Society of Magazine Editors award for Best Interactive Tool and was downloaded 500,000 times in two weeks. The magazine's first application, "Men's Health Workouts", was in the top 10 in the Health and Fitness category. In September 2009, the column "Ask Jimmy the Bartender" was turned into an iPhone and iPad application, which was downloaded 50,000 times in its first month. In 2010, Men's Health became one of the first consumer magazines to enter the iPad market.
In 2011, David Zinczenko was replaced by Bill Phillips, who was the executive editor of the magazine and editor of MensHealth.com.
In November 2014, Men's Health featured a reader on the cover for the first time with amputee and veteran Noah Galloway, the winner of the first Ultimate Men's Health Guy Search.

In 2016, Matt Bean became editor-in-chief. He hired Creative Director Mike Schnaidt to redesign the magazine with visual updates inspired by media, such as auto repair guides, hiking maps and military field manuals, added "The Exchange", "Unfiltered", "Field Guide" and a column by Tim Ferriss. He introduced the digital franchise MH Longform. In October 2017 Men's Health began the cross-platform series "The Adventurist" in partnership with Fitbit.

The test issue of Men's Health Living was edited by Bill Phillips, executive editor of Men's Health, and Matt Bean.

Global editions
Although Men's Health was founded in the US, its international editions have made it the world's largest men's magazine brand. These magazines reach over 71 million readers worldwide. Men's Health is published in 35 editions.
International editions account for over 80% of the magazine's trade volume. In each market, local editors commission or purchase articles for their own market and share content with US and other editions. The selected articles are then translated and edited by local staffers to make them match the style of the American edition. Usually, these editions started out as translations of the US version of the magazine, but over time many non-US editions became unique, providing material more pertinent to local readers.
