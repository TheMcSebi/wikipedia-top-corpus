Toyota Highlander
The Toyota Highlander, also known as the Toyota Kluger (Japanese: トヨタ・クルーガー, Hepburn: Toyota Kurūgā), is a mid-size crossover SUV with three-row seating produced by Toyota since 2000.
Announced in April 2000 at the New York International Auto Show and arriving in late 2000 in Japan and January 2001 in North America, the Highlander became one of the first car-based mid-size SUV or mid-size crossovers. The Highlander is the crossover counterpart to the more rugged, truck-based mid-size 4Runner and became Toyota's best-selling SUV before being surpassed by the smaller RAV4 in 2006.
The first-generation model was sold in Japan as the Kluger, which was exclusive to dealership network called Toyota Netz as a larger alternative to the RAV4. The Kluger nameplate is also used in Australia because "Highlander" is a trademarked trim line name owned by Hyundai. The name is derived from the German word klug, which means smart or clever ("Kluger", written in German with an Ü instead of a U, means "someone who is smarter than another").
First generation (XU20; 2000)
The Highlander (or Kluger in Japan and Australia) shared a platform with its XU30 series Lexus RX/Toyota Harrier cousin.  It came in five (2001–2007) and seven-seat (2004–2007) configurations and became a sales success for Toyota in a number of markets across the world. The Highlander came standard with front-wheel drive and offered all-wheel drive (50:50 front:rear fixed torque split). Unlike Toyota's own 4Runner and other mid-sized competitors such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee, or Chevrolet TrailBlazer, the Highlander aimed for on-road comfort with its unibody construction and independent rear suspension. Although it was longer than the 1996–2002 4Runner available at the time it was launched, the Highlander was surpassed in length by the redesigned 4Runner in August 2002.
The Highlander was available in three trim lines in the United States: the base model, the Sport model, and the Limited model. The base and Limited models were present when the Highlander was initially introduced, while the Sport model was introduced in March 2006.
In 2004, the wheels on the Limited trim changed from a six-spoke to a five-spoke alloy. The base-model Highlander wheels also changed from steel-rims to the alloy wheels that were on the 2001–2003 model year Highlander Limited and B-Package. The Sport models had a distinctive grille design, differentiating themselves from the non-Sport models. Wheel styling also serves to differentiate the various models—the hybrid sports a unique twin-spoke design.
The Kluger was introduced to Australia in October 2003. It was available in three guises: CV, CVX, and Grande. A limited edition CV Sport model was also released in 2006. There was no hybrid model available in Australia. The only engine offered was the 3.3-liter 3MZ-FE V6. Typical fuel economy using the Australian standard testing regime is 12.3 L/100 km (23.0 mpg‑imp; 19.1 mpg‑US).
Engines:
The 3.0-liter engine was able to propel the Kluger from 0–97 kilometres per hour (0–60 mph) in approximately 8.8 seconds. In 2004 the Kluger was given a new 3.3-liter V6 engine to compete with the more powerful V6 offerings from its competitors, mainly the Nissan Murano and the Honda Pilot. The larger engine made it possible for the Kluger to reach 0 to 97 km/h (0 to 60 mph) in 7.8 seconds.
2001 update
The Japanese and Australian Kluger was released with a center console integrated with the dashboard, while the North American Highlander initially lacked this integrated center console. The integrated center console was introduced in all US Highlanders and in Canadian Limited Highlanders in 2001, for the 2002 model year, and in all Canadian Highlanders in 2003, for the 2004 model year. However, for these early Highlanders without the integrated center console, a smaller non-integrated stand-alone center console was available as an option, either factory or dealer installed.
2003 update
In 2003, for the 2004 model year, in addition to the 3.3-liter engine, V6-powered models were equipped with a new five-speed automatic transmission, replacing the four-speed automatic transmission, while the inline-four models continued to use the old four-speed. This year also saw the introduction of the optional third row seat allowing for two additional passengers. The center console, which was previously exclusive to the Limited trim level, was now standard across all trims. A DVD-based navigation system was introduced to the Highlander for the first time as an option on the Limited trim. The unibody was slightly modified behind the second row seats to include a depression in the hatch floor able to accommodate the optional third row seating. On models without third row seating, this depression was turned into a storage compartment (prior to 2004 the spare tire was accessible from inside the vehicle where the third row seating would subsequently be located; beginning in 2004 the spare tire is accessible from underneath the vehicle).  Subtle changes to the front grille, front and rear bumpers, headlights and tail lights (LED tail lights on later hybrid models) round-out the major changes for the 2003 mid-cycle refresh.
2005 update
In 2005, for the 2006 model year, Highlanders sold in Canada were offered only in a V6 all-wheel drive configuration. Hybrid models were available with part-time four-wheel drive, which Toyota refers to as 4WD-i whereby the rear wheels are powered by a separate electric motor. This system is intended for use on snow and ice and is prone to overheating the rear electric motor off-road.
Safety
Anti-lock brakes, brake assist and electronic brakeforce distribution were standard, Vehicle Stability Control w/traction control optional on 2001–03 models became standard for 2004 models (Hybrids come standard with VDIM). Also standard for 2004 was a tire pressure monitor. Front seat-mounted side torso airbags were optional on 2001–06 models, while front and second row side curtain airbags were optional on 2004–06 models. Side airbags became standard on 2007 models and the curtain airbags gained a rollover sensor that year as well.
In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash tests the Highlander was rated "Good" overall in the frontal offset crash test. The IIHS reported the Highlander had one of the lowest driver fatality rates among all vehicles, and amongst SUVs, only the Toyota 4Runner had a lower driver fatality rate. This report looked at 2001–2005 model year vehicles in the US.
Hybrid (MHU28, 2005)
Initially, the Kluger was a regular, non-hybrid SUV driven by an internal combustion engine, but later Toyota introduced a hybrid version, the Kluger Hybrid that utilizes the company's Hybrid Synergy Drive technology combined with the company's 3MZ-FE 3.3-liter V6 engine offered in either FWD or AWD trim. The hybrid drivetrain was unveiled at the 2004 North American International Auto Show, and was offered to the public in July 2005 as a 2006 model. The power steering pump, water pump and AC compressor were changed from belt-drive to electrically powered versions. A modified alternator was incorporated into the hybrid system.
In North America, the hybrid version was called the Highlander Hybrid. It was also the first seven-seat hybrid vehicle. With the electric motors providing power, overall acceleration improved, particularly at passing speeds. Other additions include Toyota's Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) system and Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB). The California Air Resources Board gave it a SULEV emission rating. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (revised standards) rated it at 8.4 L/100 km; 34 mpg‑imp (28 mpg‑US) City/9.4 L/100 km; 30 mpg‑imp (25 mpg‑US) Highway for FWD models and 8.7 L/100 km; 32 mpg‑imp (27 mpg‑US)/9.4 L/100 km; 30 mpg‑imp (25 mpg‑US) for AWD models. This system is near identical to that of the Lexus RX 400h. All-wheel drive models were rated to tow 1,600 kg (3,500 lb).
Second generation (XU40; 2007)
Toyota revealed the second generation Highlander and Highlander Hybrid at the 2007 Chicago Auto Show, with American sales beginning in July and hybrids in late September. The second generation Highlander and Highlander Hybrid were not sold in Japan. The five-seat Highlander for the United States and Canada was dropped as the Venza replaced it.
Initially the sole powertrain for the 2008 Highlander was a 201-kilowatt (270 hp; 274 PS) 3.5-liter 2GR-FE V6 mated to a five-speed automatic. The four-cylinder model had been discontinued but added again in 2009. While the 3.5-liter engine has 41 kilowatts (55 hp; 56 PS) more  than the previous 3.3-liter V6 and dimensional increases along with increased sound proofing added nearly 225 kilograms (500 lb) to the vehicle's curb weight of approximately 1,815 kilograms (4,000 lb), fuel economy is slightly improved. The EPA estimated fuel economy for front-wheel drive models is at
13 L/100 km; 22 mpg‑imp (18 mpg‑US) city / 9.8 L/100 km; 29 mpg‑imp (24 mpg‑US) highway (last gen: 14 L/100 km; 20 mpg‑imp (17 mpg‑US) city / 10 L/100 km; 28 mpg‑imp (23 mpg‑US) hwy).
For 2009, Toyota again offered a 4-cylinder for 5-passenger front-wheel drive models with the all-new ULEV-II certified 2.7-liter 1AR-FE I4 paired to a six-speed automatic. It generates 139 kW (187 hp; 190 PS) at 5,800 rpm and 252 N⋅m (186 lb⋅ft) of peak torque at 4,100 rpm on regular 87 octane fuel. The four-cylinder delivers an EPA estimated fuel economy of 12 L/100 km; 24 mpg‑imp (20 mpg‑US) city and 8.7 L/100 km; 32 mpg‑imp (27 mpg‑US) highway. This is better than the previous model's four-cylinder with 12 L/100 km; 23 mpg‑imp (19 mpg‑US)/9.4 L/100 km; 30 mpg‑imp (25 mpg‑US).
The same three trim levels were offered (Base, Sport and Limited) until early 2010 when the SE model replaced the Sport model, buyers are still able to choose between front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive on V6 platforms. Also new is an Electric Power Steering (EPS) system. Sport and Limited models get a standard backup camera using a 3.5-inch LCD display. Major options include leather seats, heated seats, a touchscreen DVD based navigation system, a new Smart Key System, an upgraded JBL Synthesis stereo, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system with 9-inch screen, and a towing package that increases towing capacity to 5000 pounds.
The XU40 was initially produced exclusively at Toyota Motor Kyushu's Miyata plant for all global markets beginning in May 2007. Production in China for local sales was started on 25 May 2009 by GAC Toyota in Nansha District, Guangzhou, Guangdong. Toyota had intended on building the Highlander in Blue Springs, Mississippi for the North American market in the 2011 model year. However, the Corolla was built there instead, and the Highlander is being built at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana in Princeton, Indiana, from the 2010 model year onward for a majority of North America, replacing Tundra production. TMMI Highlander production began in October 2009 for gasoline engine models only; hybrids continued to be imported from Japan until the release of the third generation XU50, where all production except for China was consolidated at TMMI.
In Australia, the new generation Kluger was launched in August 2007. There are three trims available, KX-R, KX-S and Grande. All trims are available with either 2WD or AWD. The base model KX-R is also available with either five or seven seats, whilst the latter trims are seven seaters only. Specifications are mostly similar to the US Highlander, sharing the same 3.5-litre V6 2GR-FE engine and five-speed automatic transmission. However, there are no plans at present to introduce a hybrid version of the Kluger into the Australian market.
2010 update
In 2010, for the 2011 model year, Toyota made some changes to the Highlander and Highlander Hybrid. While the general design remains similar to the 2010 model, the Highlander's front end has been significantly revised, now featuring new headlights, a new black with chrome accent rocker panel, and new front grille. The non-hybrid engines for 2011 remain the same, although now the 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine may be had on the SE trim level, previously only available on the base model. More standard features are now equipped on all trim levels, with the base model receiving front and rear air conditioning, power locks/windows, cruise control, and a multi-function keyless entry control. The facelifted model was also sold in Russia from 2010-2013.

Safety
All models come standard with enhanced Vehicle Stability Control which immediately alters electric powering steering assist w/traction control (hybrids come standard with VDIM), anti-lock brakes, brake assist and electronic brakeforce distribution. Also standard is a tire pressure monitor, a driver's knee airbag, front seat-mounted side torso airbags, side curtain airbags for all three rows which includes a rollover sensor and active front headrests. Hill Start Assist Control (HAC) is also standard which prevents rolling backwards on slopes, and Downhill Assist Control (DAC) is standard on AWD trims.
The IIHS rates the Highlander "Good" overall in their frontal offset crash test, and good in all subcategories except for "Head/neck," which is rated as "Acceptable." And "Good" overall in the side impact crash test, with "Good" rating in all nine measured categories. The Highlander is also rated "Good" in the roof strength test, giving it a "top safety pick" rating.
In Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) testing the Kluger is given a  rating but only a  rating for pedestrian protection.
The safety and effectiveness of the Highlander/Kluger's Vehicle Stability Control system has been questioned by some motoring journalists. During testing for Wheels magazine Car of the Year in 2007, the magazine's editor rolled the vehicle during high-speed gravel road testing. Noting that it was the first such event in the magazine's 45-year history, he criticised the vehicle's stability system stating that "Deficiencies in the Kluger's ESP contributed to the crash". Six of the seven other judges also stated that they felt "the vehicle's ESP performance was sub-standard", and remarked that the vehicle was "almost dangerous on dirt [roads]". In a written response, Toyota disputed the circumstances of the accident and criticised the testing procedures as "unscientific".
Hybrid
The Hybrid features Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive which continues to allow an electric only powered mode for short distances and speeds. Weight and cost have been improved over the previous hybrid.
The expanded size and new features have led to an increase of 500 pounds to its curb weight. All Highlander Hybrids are all-wheel drive, and the EPA has rated the hybrid at 8.7 L/100 km; 32 mpg‑imp (27 mpg‑US) for the city and 9.4 L/100 km; 30 mpg‑imp (25 mpg‑US) for the highway, same as the previous model. The Highlander's fuel economy, while better than the Lexus RX 400h's, lags behind the compact 4cyl Ford Escape Hybrid, which ceased production in 2012, and the latest RX 450h, but still produces significantly fewer emissions than the non-hybrid version with a CARB SULEV rating.
The Highlander Hybrid continues to use the same 3.3-liter 3MZ-FE V6 (155 kW (208 hp; 211 PS)) offered in AWD from the prior model, net power is 175 kW (235 hp; 238 PS). VDIM and Electronically Controlled Brake remain new features include a driver selectable electric only EV mode (when possible) and another ECON mode which restricts acceleration and minimizes air conditioning during acceleration. The Highlander Hybrid Hybrid uses a 1.9 kWh sealed nickel-metal hydride traction battery.
For the 2011 model year the Highlander Hybrid received styling changes and was upgraded with the 3.5-liter 2GR-FXE V6 (183 kW (245 hp; 248 PS)), increasing net power by 7 kW (10 hp; 10 PS), and a powertrain similar to the RX450h. The vehicle is now rated at 8 L/100 km; 34 mpg‑imp (28 mpg‑US) for the city, highway and combined cycles.
Highlander FCHV (2007)
The Highland FCHV was a test vehicle using compressed hydrogen gas, with average fuel economy of 109.9 km/kg (68.3 miles per kilogram) (approximate mpg equivalent).
The vehicle was unveiled at the 2007 LA Auto Show.
Chinese version
The Chinese version of the Highlander (ASU40/GSU45) was unveiled in 2009 at the 13th Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition.
Third generation (XU50; 2013)
On 27 March 2013, Toyota unveiled the third generation XU50 series Highlander at the New York International Auto Show, with plans to have the vehicle reach dealerships in early 2014. Production began on 5 December. The XU50 version is longer and wider than the outgoing generation and its design has changed from its boxy look to one that is similar to other mid-size crossover SUVs.
In addition to the changes, the XU50 featured seating for eight people with a sliding second-row point of entry that gives it 109 millimetres (4.3 in) of added width space, soft-touch materials on the instrument panel, lane-departure warning, pre-collision warning and blind spot monitoring systems. HD Radio and Bluetooth was standard on all trims for the US version, which will also come equipped with Toyota's Entune multimedia system along with a 6.1-inch touchscreen display audio system. An eight-inch touchscreen system and Toyota's Entune app suite with 12 JBL speakers were offered as an optional feature. The three powertrain trims that were offered include a 2.7-liter, six-speed automatic, front-wheel drive base model, a 3.5-liter, six-speed automatic model in both front- or all-wheel drive, and the AWD-only Hybrid trim with a 3.5-liter V6 mated to an eCVT.
The Highlander is also approved for use as a New York City taxicab.
For the third-generation model, Toyota Motor Sales USA took the role of producing the Kluger for Australia and New Zealand after Japanese production of the second-generation model ended in 2013. When the model was replaced with the succeeding XU70 model in 2019, production in the US continued for exports to both countries until 2021.
2016 facelift
A refreshed 2017 model year Highlander appeared at the New York International Auto Show in March 2016 with sales starting in the fourth quarter of 2016. In V6 powered models, an eight-speed automatic replaced the six-speeder and the revised V6 engine (now designated 2GR-FKS) added Toyota's D4-S direct injection fuel system. The facelifted Highlander has an updated fascia with restyled headlights and tail lights, addition of SE trim, XLE and LE Hybrid trims, and updated exterior and interior colors.

Fourth generation (XU70; 2019)
The fourth-generation Highlander was unveiled at the New York International Auto Show on 17 April 2019. It is built on GA-K platform. In the United States, the fourth-generation Highlander gasoline model went on sale on 18 December 2019 for the 2020 model year. Compared to the previous generation, there is increased cargo room behind the third row and support was added for both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The hybrid model became available in North America in February 2020. The fourth-generation Highlander offers five trim levels, three of which are carried over from the previous generation: LE, XLE, and Limited, as well the base L, and the top-of-the-line Platinum.
In Europe, the Highlander Hybrid went on sale in January 2021, solely with a hybrid powertrain. The Highlander for the UK market has been available since March 2021, a year later than the US models due to the extensive engineering work for right-hand-drive models, while the Kluger for the Australian market became available on 1 June 2021.
China
In China, the fourth-generation Highlander was launched on 19 April 2021 at the Auto Shanghai. The Highlander continued to be built and sold by GAC Toyota joint venture. A twin model manufactured by FAW Toyota was launched simultaneously as the Crown Kluger (simplified Chinese: 皇冠陆放; traditional Chinese: 皇冠陸放; pinyin: Huángguàn Lùfàng). The Crown Kluger is based on the Highlander XSE sold in North America, with the Toyota badge on the front grille and steering wheel swapped for the Crown badge. Both are powered by a 2.5-liter engine with hybrid powertrain as an option.
