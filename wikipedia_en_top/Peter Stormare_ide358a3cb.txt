Early life
Rolf Peter Ingvar Storm was born in Kumla on August 27, 1953. Soon after, his family moved to Arbrå. He changed his surname when he discovered he shared it with a senior student at an acting academy. Like "storm" (which has the same meaning in Swedish and English), stormare is a Swedish word meaning "stormer". Before settling on Stormare, he briefly contemplated changing his name to Retep Mrots, which is "Peter Storm" backwards.
