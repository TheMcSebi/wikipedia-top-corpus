2018–19 snooker world rankings
The sport of professional snooker has had a world ranking system in place since 1976. Certain tournaments were given "ranking" status, with the results at those events  contributing to a player's world ranking. The events that made up the 1976–77 snooker season were the first to use a ranking points system. Originally, the world rankings were decided based only on results in the World Snooker Championship, but other events were later added. The system used for the 2018–19 snooker season was first used in the 2010–11 season, where players won ranking points based entirely on prize money won from these events. The rankings are based on the prior two seasons, with eleven revisions after specific tournaments throughout the season. These revisions are used as official rankings, with points awarded in the current season overwriting those from two years prior.

Revision dates
Seedings for each event were based on the world rankings, with totals being updated at specific revision dates. On these dates, ranking points from the 2016–17 snooker season were removed from a player's total.
