Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress
The Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress is an award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). It is given to honor an actress who has delivered an outstanding performance in a supporting role while working within the film industry. The award is traditionally presented by the previous year's Best Supporting Actor winner.
At the 9th Academy Awards ceremony held in 1937, Gale Sondergaard was the first winner of this award for her role in Anthony Adverse. Initially, winners in both supporting acting categories were awarded plaques instead of statuettes. Beginning with the 16th ceremony held in 1944, winners received full-sized statuettes. Currently, nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the actors branch of AMPAS; winners are selected by a plurality vote from all eligible voting members of the Academy.
Since its inception, the award has been given to 84 actresses. Dianne Wiest and Shelley Winters have received the most awards in this category with two awards each. Despite winning no awards, Thelma Ritter was nominated on six occasions, more than any other actress. At age 10, Tatum O'Neal became the youngest actress to win this award for Paper Moon (1973), and at age 77, Peggy Ashcroft became the oldest winner in this category for A Passage to India (1984). As of the 2022 ceremony, Ariana DeBose is the most recent winner in this category for her role as Anita in West Side Story. DeBose became the first Afro-Latina and second Hispanic woman overall to win an acting Oscar after Rita Moreno who won in 1962 for the same role in the original film, marking the first time two actresses won Oscars for the same role.
