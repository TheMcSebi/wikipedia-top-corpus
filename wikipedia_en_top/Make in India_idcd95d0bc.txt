Make in India
Make in India is an initiative by the Government of India to create and encourage companies to develop, manufacture and assemble products made in India and incentivize dedicated investments into manufacturing. The policy approach was to create a conducive environment for investments, develop a modern and efficient infrastructure, and open up new sectors for foreign capital. The initiative targeted 25 economic sectors for job creation and skill enhancement, and aimed "to transform India into a global design and manufacturing export hub."


"Make in India" had three stated objectives:
After the launch, India gave investment commitments worth ₹16.40 lakh crore (US$210 billion) and investment inquiries worth of ₹1.5 lakh crore (US$19 billion) between September 2014 to February 2016. As a result, India emerged as the top destination globally in 2015 for foreign direct investment (FDI), surpassing the United States and China, with US$60.1 billion FDI.
As per the current policy, 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted in all 100 sectors, except for Space industry (74%), defence industry (49%) and Media of India (26%). Japan and India had also announced a US$12 billion 'Japan-India Make-in-India Special Finance Facility" fund to push investment.
In line with the Make in India, individual states too launched their own local initiatives, such as "Make in Odisha", "Tamil Nadu Global Investors Meet", "Vibrant Gujarat", "Happening Haryana", and "Magnetic Maharashtra". India received US$60 billion FDI in FY 2016–17.
The World Bank's 2019 Ease of Doing Business report acknowledges India's jump of 23 positions against its rank of 100 in 2017 to be placed now at 63rd rank among 190 countries. By the end of 2017, India had risen 42 places on Ease of doing business index, 32 places World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, and 19 notches in the Logistics Performance Index, thanks to recent governmental initiatives, which include converges, synergies and enables other important Government of India schemes, such as Bharatmala, Sagarmala, Dedicated Freight Corridors, Industrial corridors, UDAN-RCS, Bharat Broadband Network, Digital India.
Make in India has not yet achieved its goals. The growth rate of manufacturing averaged 6.9% per annum between 2014–15 and 2019–20. The share of manufacturing dropped from 16.3% of GDP in 2014–15 to 14.3% in 2020–21.

Ease of Doing Business
India has jumped to 63rd place out of 190 countries in the world Banks' 2019 Ease of Doing Business Index from 130th in 2016. In February 2017, the government appointed the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the National Productivity Council "to sensitise actual users and get their feedback on various reform measures." As a result, now there is competition among the states of India to improve their current ranking on the ease of doing business index based on the completion percentage scores on 98-point action plan for business reform under Make in India initiative. Currently Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Chhattisgarh are top six states (c. Oct 2020).
