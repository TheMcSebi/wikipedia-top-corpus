Today, Greensburg stands as a model "green town", often described as the greenest in America. The hospital, city hall, and school have all been built to the highest certification level issued by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED).
History
Early history
For millennia, the Great Plains of North America were inhabited by nomadic Native Americans.
19th century
The first settlement was made at Greensburg in 1885. Greensburg was named for D.R. "Cannonball" Green, who owned a stagecoach company and who helped to form the city. In 1887, construction began on the Big Well, the largest hand-dug well in the world. In 1888, Greensburg was advertised as the "liveliest town in the state." In the same year, the Big Well finished construction.
20th century
The Big Well stopped being a source of the city's water in 1932.
One of the largest pallasite meteorites ever discovered was found near Greensburg in 1949, weighing over 1,000 pounds.
In 1972, the Big Well was declared a national museum.
21st century
At 9:45 p.m. CDT on May 4, 2007, during a deadly tornado outbreak, Greensburg was hit by an EF5 tornado. The tornado was estimated to be 1.7 miles (2.7 km) in width — wider than the city itself — and traveled for nearly 22 miles (35 km). Ninety-five percent of the city was confirmed to be destroyed, with the other five percent being severely damaged. The National Weather Service estimated winds of the tornado to reach 205 mph (330 km/h). This was the first tornado to be rated EF5 since the implementation of the Enhanced Fujita scale earlier that year and the first F5 or EF5 classification since May 3, 1999, when an F5 tornado ripped through Moore, Oklahoma, as part of the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak. Tornado sirens sounded in the city twenty minutes before the tornado struck, and a tornado emergency was issued, which undoubtedly saved many lives. The tornado lasted for a total of one hour and five minutes and caused $250 million dollars in damages.
Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius and President George W. Bush both declared Kiowa County a disaster area, which opened up the affected areas for national and international aid. The tornado took 10 lives in Greensburg and two more in neighboring towns. While some rebuilding was done, the population by 2010 was about 50% of what it was in 2000, as the 2000 census found 1,574 residents, while only 777 were recorded in the 2010 census.
After the tornado, the city council passed a resolution stating that all city buildings would be built to LEED — platinum standards, making it the first city in the nation to do so. Greensburg is rebuilding as a "green" town, with the help of Greensburg GreenTown, a non-profit organization created to help the residents learn about and implement the green living initiative. With extra help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Greensburg residents developed a long-term plan for Greensburg. The city's power is supplied by ten 1.25 MW wind-turbines. Carbon offsets generated from the turbines are being managed by NativeEnergy, and have been purchased by charter supporters including Ben & Jerry's, Clif Bar, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, and Stonyfield Farm. Greensburg also has numerous electric vehicle charging stations and complimentary bikes.

Attractions
Greensburg is home to the world's largest hand dug well. Work had begun on the well in 1887 to provide water for the steam engines of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. When the well was completed in 1888 it was 109 feet (33 m) deep and 32 feet (9.8 m) in diameter. The well was used as the city's water supply until 1932. In 1939 it was opened as a tourist attraction allowing visitors to descend to the bottom of the well. The adjacent museum displayed a 1000-pound pallasite meteorite until the museum fell down around the meteorite during the 2007 tornado that destroyed the city. The Well was not destroyed, and the meteorite was found in the rubble of the museum and moved to a temporary home in Hays, Kansas while Greensburg was rebuilding. In May 2012, the new Big Well Museum and Visitor Information Center opened featuring exhibits about the history of Greensburg, The Big Well, the 2007 tornado, rebuilding and Space Wanderer Pallasite Meteorite.
On October 16, 2006, a related smaller meteorite measuring 154 pounds (70 kilograms) was dug up near Greensburg (5 miles (8.0 km)) and Haviland (4 miles (6.4 km)). The only scientific publication discussing time of impact suggests a terrestrial age of 20,000 years. It was once thought that its age was around 10,000 years.
The town serves as a time station for the annual Race Across America, a 3,000 miles (4,800 km) transcontinental bicycle race.

Media
Several television networks have drawn an interest in Greensburg as a subject for reality shows as a result of the Greensburg City Council's decision to make the city a "green" town. A documentary on its reconstruction, called Greensburg, aired on Planet Green, a sister network of Discovery Channel.
Another documentary, Earth 2100, drew attention to Greensburg as "the green town" that was built after the devastating 2007 tornado. The ABC film suggested a fictionalized, future Greensburg as a model showing how American towns can successfully implement green technology, and become a beacon for hope on a planet doomed to destruction from climate change and overpopulation.
Multiple books have been written about Greensburg and the 2007 tornado. Greensburg: The Twisted Tales (Janice Haney) recounts several residents' experiences with the tornado. Aftermath: Scenes from the Sudden Destruction of an American Hometown (Merlin Peck) showcases images of destruction and debris from the event.
