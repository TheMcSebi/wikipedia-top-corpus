History
JetBrains, initially called IntelliJ Software, was founded in 2000 in Prague by three Russian software developers: Sergey Dmitriev, Valentin Kipyatkov and Eugene Belyaev. The company's first product was IntelliJ Renamer, a tool for code refactoring in Java.
In 2012 CEO Sergey Dmitriev left the company and was replaced by Oleg Stepanov and Maxim Shafirov.
In 2021 The New York Times stated that unknown parties might have embedded malware in JetBrains' software that led to the SolarWinds hack and other widespread security compromises. In a press release, JetBrains said they had not been contacted by any government or security agency and had not "taken part or been involved in this attack in any way". The CEO of one of the affected companies, SolarWinds, "asked about the possibility that software tools made by JetBrains, which speeds the development and testing of code, was the pathway, Mr. Ramakrishna said there was still no evidence".
In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the company suspended sales and R&D activities in Russia indefinitely as well as sales in Belarus.

In June 2015, it was announced that the support of Eclipse ADT would be discontinued making Android Studio the official tool for Android App development.
In January 2020, JetBrains released a geometric monospaced font called JetBrains Mono, made the default font for their IDEs, under the Apache License 2.0. The font is designed for reading source code by being optimized for reading vertically with support for programming ligatures.
