History
Jingzhou has been inhabited for approximately 5,000 to 6,000 years, with the historic Daxi culture residing in present-day Jingzhou. Situated in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the area has been a strategic location of military importance since ancient times.
The area of present-day Jingzhou was where the State of Chu was founded. Ying, an ancient city within the borders of present-day Jingzhou, became the capital of the State of Chu in 689 BCE, and remained as such for over 400 years, including during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods of the Zhou Dynasty.
During the Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms era, Jingzhou was known as Nanjun due to it being the seat of Nanjun district.
The city was lost to Eastern Wu by Guan Yu during the Three Kingdoms period leading to the modern phrase "dàyì shī Jīngzhōu" (大意失荆州), lit. 'carelessness lost Jingzhou'.
Under the Tang dynasty, it served as the southern capital and was known as Nandu (南都; 'south capital').
Later on, Jiangling  was the capital of the Southern Qi and Liang dynasties. It was the capital of the small Jingnan Kingdom (also known as Nanping) that existed from 924 to 963 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period.
Jingzhou was the site of one of the last major battles between Republican and Qing forces during the Xinhai Revolution in 1911. At the end of the Qing dynasty, Jingzhou had one of the largest Manchu populations, around half of the city, anywhere outside Beijing.
In July 1949, the area was taken by the People's Liberation Army.
On September 29, 1994, Jiangling County and Shashi City were merged to create the prefecture-level city of Jingsha. On November 20, 1996, Jingsha was renamed to Jingzhou.
