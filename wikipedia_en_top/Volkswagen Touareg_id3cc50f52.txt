Volkswagen Touareg
The Volkswagen Touareg (German pronunciation: [ˈtuːaʁɛk]) is a car produced by German automaker Volkswagen Group since 2002 at the Volkswagen Bratislava Plant. A five-seater mid-size luxury crossover SUV, the vehicle was named after the nomadic Tuareg people, inhabitants of the Saharan interior in North Africa. As of its first generation, the Touareg was developed together with the Porsche Cayenne and the Audi Q7, and as of October 2020, the Touareg was developed together with the Audi Q8, the Bentley Bentayga and the Lamborghini Urus. The vehicles were designed as unibody SUVs with independent suspensions. The initial generation (2002–2010) offered five-, six-, eight-, ten- and twelve-cylinder engine choices.
Development
The Volkswagen Touareg (internally designated Typ 7L) was developed as a joint venture project by Porsche and the Volkswagen Group, involving the Audi and Volkswagen brands. At the time of Typ 7L development and for the first several years of production, Porsche was independently owned and not yet a part of the Volkswagen group. The sports car market fluctuates, and Porsche CEO Wendelin Wiedeking was looking to expand into new segments; this included marketing its first four-door vehicle. A team in Weissach, Germany, of over 300, led by Klaus-Gerhard Wolpert, developed the Volkswagen Group PL71 platform. Now it is shared between the Touareg, the Audi Q7, and the Porsche Cayenne. However, there are styling, equipment, performance, and technical differences between them. The Touareg and Cayenne both seat five, while the Q7's stretched wheelbase accommodates a third row for seven passengers. 
The Volkswagen Touareg is built at the Volkswagen Bratislava Plant in Bratislava, Slovakia, alongside the Audi Q7. The Cayenne is assembled by Porsche in Leipzig, Germany, at a facility built for Cayenne production.  
Due to the demand and the exchange rates of euros against the US dollar, as well as different pricing and environmental policies in the US, the V6 and V8 engine variants make up most of Volkswagen's American Touareg offering. Compared to other Volkswagen-branded vehicles sold in the US, which are aimed at the mass market, Touaregs came in more upscale trims and competed with other luxury crossover SUVs.
First generation (7L; 2002)

The Touareg comes as standard with a 4motion four-wheel drive system. It has an automatic progressively locking centre differential (with manual override) and a "low range" setting that can be activated with in-cabin controls. The Touareg featured an optional 4-wheel active air suspension, which can raise the ride height on command, and a locking rear differential to increase off-road capability. A rare option was a front-locking differential. Its load level ground clearance is at 6.3 in (160 mm), Off-Road Level is at 9.6 in (244 mm), and extra clearance of 11.8 in (300 mm).
W12 (2005–2010)
The 6.0-litre double overhead camshaft (DOHC), 48-valve W12 engine version was initially intended to be a limited-edition model, with just 500 units planned to be produced; around 330 were slated for sale in Saudi Arabia, with the remainder sold in Europe. Some of those W12 Touaregs were sold in China, but the number sold is unknown. No sales were made in the United States. Eventually, the W12 model became an ordinary model without any production restrictions. It is estimated to reach 100 kilometres per hour (62.1 mph) in 5.9 seconds.
V10 TDI (2002–2008)
The V10 TDI was offered in the United States for a limited time in 2004, but emissions regulations forced it off the market temporarily.
The V10 TDI returned to the U.S. market as a 2006 model-year vehicle in five states. Later US models went on sale in 2006, which was compliant with 50 states emission with Ultra-low sulphur diesel and particulate filter.  Stricter California Air Resources Board (CARB) emissions standards resulted in the V10 TDI being reduced to only 43 state emissions in 2008 before being cancelled again in the United States. The V10 engine was replaced by a V6 TDI engine that met the CARB minimum emission requirements for the 2009 model year.
Fifth Gear used this version for testing to tow a Boeing 747.
Facelift (2006-2010)
The Touareg's first facelift was unveiled at the 2006 Paris Motor Show, with its North American debut at the 2007 New York Auto Show as a 2008 model. It now features the shield grille styling shared with other vehicles in the Volkswagen range. The updated Touareg has more than 2300 redesigned parts and boasts some new technological features:
The 2007 Touareg, alongside an already lengthy options list, could be equipped with a driving dynamics package, a rollover sensor, a 620-watt Dynaudio sound system, and redesigned comfort seats. All diesel versions now have the diesel particulate filter standard.
In the US and Canada, the face-lifted Touareg was marketed as the Touareg 2 for the 2008–2010 model years, reverting to simply Touareg in 2011.
R50 (2007–2010)
The Touareg R50 is the third Volkswagen after the Golf and Passat to be given the 'R' treatment by Volkswagen Individual GmbH. The R50 global launch was at the 2007 Australian International Motor Show.
The "R50" naming comes from the engine displacement: 5.0 L. The R50 was offered with a 5.0-litre V10 diesel engine that produces 257 kW (349 PS; 345 bhp) and 850 N⋅m (627 lbf⋅ft) of torque, pushing the car from 0 to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 6.7 seconds.
The R50 came standard with 21-inch Omanyt wheels, sport-tuned air suspension, decorative 'engine spin' finish interior trim inlays, and an optional four-zone Climatronic climate control system.
V6 TDI (2007–2010)
The 2007 version of the V6 TDI has 239 PS (176 kW; 236 hp) and 500 N⋅m (369 lbf⋅ft) of torque. With this engine, the Touareg can reach 100 km/h (62 mph) from a standstill in 8.3 seconds.
V6 TDI Clean Diesel (2009–2016)
The V6 TDI Clean Diesel featuring Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system replaced the V10 TDI in US and Canada. The Touareg contains a 4.5 US gallons (17 l; 3.7 imp gal) tank in the rear of the vehicle underneath the spare tyre, which stores the AdBlue solution. It is estimated that this tank will need to be replenished every 6,000–10,000 miles (9,700–16,100 km). The Touareg does not include the NOX storage catalyst found in Jetta Clean Diesel TDI due to its heavy weight.
The Touareg BlueTDI was unveiled at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show. The production version of the V6 TDI Clean Diesel was unveiled at the 2008 LA Auto Show.
Sander Kuiken, Technical development diesel application, Volkswagen AG, was one of the engineers that worked on the AdBlue system created by Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. Kuiken talked about the difference between the VW Touareg diesel and gasoline vehicles.
Touareg "Lux Limited" (2009)
The Touareg "Lux Limited" is a version of the V6 TDI Clean Diesel (225PS), V6 FSI, and V8 FSI for the US market. It features 20-inch alloy wheels ("Mountain" type) with size 275 all-season tires and a choice of 4 body colours (Sapphire Blue, Black Magic Pearl, Campanella White, and Galapagos Gray). It also came equipped with a full body colour aerodynamics kit, dual power front seats, full Cricket two-tone leather interior, touch screen navigation with streaming Bluetooth audio, 320-watt 11-speaker audio system, and adaptive high-intensity discharge headlamps.
The vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 NAIAS.
Touareg V6 TSI Hybrid (2009)
The Touareg V6 TSI Hybrid is a prototype hybrid vehicle featuring a 2,995 cc (182.8 cu in) V6 petrol engine with a 'Twin Vortices Series' (TVS) supercharger rated at 333 PS (245 kW; 328 bhp) at 5,500 rpm and 440 N⋅m (325 lbf⋅ft) of torque at 3,000 rpm, an electric motor rated at 52 PS (38 kW; 51 bhp) and 300 N⋅m (220 lbf⋅ft) of torque and an eight-speed automatic transmission. It has combined ratings of 374 PS (275 kW; 369 bhp) and 550 N⋅m (406 lbf⋅ft) of torque. The electric motor is powered by a 240-cell, 288 V, 6 Ah nickel metal-hydride battery array. The 4motion four-wheel drive system utilised a lighter Torsen centre differential from the Audi Q7 to save weight. The electric motor has a top speed of 50 km/h (31 mph). Start-stop system supports regenerative braking, and coasting. Power steering and air conditioning were changed to be powered by battery.
The planned production version included a special E-switch that the driver can activate for pure electric driving, 160 km/h (99 mph) coasting speed.

Marketing
In Canada and the US, ads showed the Touareg capable of feats that other Volkswagen cars could not accomplish, such as going right through a snowbank while a New Beetle got stuck.
A 2007 Volkswagen Touareg V10 TDI pulled a Boeing 747 as part of an advertising campaign, which holds the world record for the heaviest load towed by a passenger car.
In 2007 Día de los Innocents, Volkswagen Spain's website, showed a fake Touareg Cabrio convertible. The site was registered to VW's Spanish division.
As part of the Touareg 2 launch campaign coinciding with the premier of The Bourne Ultimatum movie, Volkswagen launched an interactive stunt simulator that allowed fans to play out their own stunts online. Users could maneuver any of six different VW models through various explosions, while altering vehicle speeds, props, sound effects, and camera angles to make that perfect scene.
Second generation (7P; 2010)
The second generation (Typ 7P) Touareg was revealed on February 10, 2010, in Munich and later at the 2010 Beijing International Auto Show.
The new Touareg features a world-first automotive headlight technology: the "Dynamic Light Assist" glare-free high beam. Unlike an adaptive high-beam system, the Dynamic Light Assist system continually and gradually adjusts not only the high-beam range but also its pattern. The beam pattern changes its direction continually so that vehicles in front are not being illuminated, while the area surrounding them is being constantly illuminated at high beam intensity.
