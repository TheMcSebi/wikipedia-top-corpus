History
Go First was founded as GoAir on 4 November 2005 by Jeh Wadia, son of Indian industrialist Nusli Wadia. The airline is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wadia Group. GoAir commenced its operations using an Airbus A320 aircraft and operated its inaugural flight from Mumbai to Ahmedabad on 4 November 2005. The airline initially operated with a single aircraft to four destinations including Goa and Coimbatore with plans to induct 36 aircraft by 2008. In March 2008, the airline announced revised plans to operate 11 aircraft and service new destinations in North East and South India by the end of the year. Increasing fuel prices forced Go First to cut down the existing number of flights in June 2008.
In January 2009, British Airways was interested in buying a stake in the airline. In November 2009, GoAir entered into talks with Indian airline SpiceJet over a possible merger which ended in a no deal. In April 2012, GoAir became the fifth largest airline in India in terms of market share following the demise of Kingfisher Airlines. In 2013, the airline appointed investment bank JP Morgan to scout for potential investors. The airline's growth has been slow compared to other airlines established at the same time such as IndiGo and SpiceJet, which have larger market share, fleet size and destinations served as of 2016.
According to the airline, it is a planned strategy due to the tough aviation environment in India and to focus on maintaining profitability rather than on capturing market share and increasing the destinations and fleet size. As of February 2016, it was the fifth largest carrier in the country with an 8% market share. The airline is planning for an initial public offering (IPO) in 2020. The airline took delivery of its 20th aircraft in June 2016, making it eligible to operate international flights.
GoAir became the sixth Indian domestic carrier to fly international when it launched its inaugural flight to Phuket from New Delhi on 11 October 2018.
On 17 March 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, GoAir suspended its international flights. On 13 May 2021, GoAir was rebranded as Go First.
