Julio Jones
Quintorris Lopez "Julio" Jones Jr. (/ˈhuːlioʊ/; born February 8, 1989) is an American football wide receiver for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Alabama, and was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in the first round (6th overall) of the 2011 NFL Draft. He is regarded as one of the best receivers of the 2010s.


After a productive rookie season, Jones recorded 1,198 receiving yards and ten touchdowns in 2012 and was named to his first Pro Bowl. After an injury-plagued 2013 season where he only played five games, Jones led the Falcons in receiving yards in 2014, and made his second Pro Bowl, beginning to develop a deep chemistry with team quarterback Matt Ryan. Jones broke out the next season, leading the league in receiving yards and co-leading in receptions, both of his statistics ranking top five all-time in a season. After this season, he was named to his first All-Pro selection. In 2016, Jones again had a productive year, garnering another All-Pro selection, and helped to lead the Falcons to Super Bowl LI. Over the next three seasons, Jones amassed 4,515 yards, the most by any player during that span, including leading the league again in yards in 2018.
With the Falcons, Jones amassed 12,896 receiving yards, most by a receiver since entering the league, and more than any receiver in the 2010s, with 12,125 yards during that span. In doing so, Jones was invited to seven Pro Bowls, including six consecutive from 2014 to 2019, was a first-team All-Pro selection twice and was named second-team All-Pro three times.
Jones has been noted for having a rare combination of size (6 ft 3 in and 220 lbs), speed (40-yard dash in 4.39 seconds), catching ability, strength, leaping ability, and body control, which has drawn frequent comparisons to Calvin Johnson. On November 11, 2018, Jones became the fastest player in NFL history to reach 10,000 career receiving yards. On September 15, 2019, Jones became the all-time career receiving yards leader for the Falcons. On October 5, 2020, Jones became the all-time career receptions leader for the Falcons. His career average of 91.9 receiving yards per game is the highest in NFL history, and as of 2021 he is tied for third all-time in career games with 100-yards receiving with 59 career games. In 2021 after another injury-plagued 2020 season, Jones was traded to the Titans after reported disgruntlement with Atlanta's new front office. After being released by the Titans in 2022, Jones signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Early life
Julio Jones was born on February 8, 1989, as Quintorris Lopez “Julio” Jones in Foley, Alabama. His mother, Queen Marvin, raised him and his brother alone, since his father left him when Jones was just 5 years old. Jones grew up in a violent neighborhood. Jones attended Foley High School in Foley, Alabama, where he played wide receiver and defensive end for the Lions high school football team. During his high school career, Jones quickly achieved recognition. In his junior year, he caught 75 passes for 1,306 yards and had 16 touchdowns. People referred to him as "Waffle House" because he was always open. He participated in the high school Under Armour All-America Game.
In addition to football, Jones was a starter on the basketball team and was a standout track athlete. He was the state champion in the long jump (24–2 or 7.40m) and triple jump (47–5 or 14.52m) in both 2006 and 2007. He was named the 2006–07 Gatorade T&F Athlete of the Year in the state of Alabama. He was the state champion in the high jump (6–6 or 1.98m) during the 2007 indoor season. He was named All-county selection in 2005, 2006, and 2007. He won Mr. Alabama Track & Field athlete of the year in 2007. He also competed as a sprinter in 2008 and posted a personal-best time of 11.13 seconds in the 100-meter dash at the Class 6A Section 1 Meet, where he placed second.
Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Jones was listed as the No. 1 wide receiver in the nation in 2008. On February 6, 2008, Jones committed to the Alabama Crimson Tide on National Signing Day, announcing his decision live on ESPNU.
College career
2008 season
In the first of three years on the Crimson Tide, Jones quickly became an impact player and a fan favorite under head coach Nick Saban. Jones became the first true freshman wide receiver ever to start in a season opener for the Crimson Tide, starting against the Clemson Tigers in the 2008 Chick-fil-A College Kickoff; Jones caught four passes for 28 yards and a touchdown in a 34–10 rout. In a 41–30 win over the #3 ranked Georgia Bulldogs, Jones had a breakout performance, catching five passes for 94-yards including a 22-yard touchdown reception from John Parker Wilson. His first 100-yard receiving game occurred in the annual rivalry game versus Tennessee, when he had six receptions for 103-yards en route to a 29–9 victory. Two weeks later, versus #16 LSU, Jones topped his previous performance with seven catches for 128-yards. His 23-yard reception in overtime set up a game-winning touchdown by John Parker Wilson, giving Alabama a 27–21 victory. In the 2008 SEC Championship Game, Jones caught five passes for 124 yards. In the first quarter, Jones caught a 64-yard pass which set up the Crimson Tide's first score of the game. However, #1 Alabama fell to No. 2 Florida by a score of 31–20, the  Tide's first loss of the year. Jones finished his freshman season leading all receivers for the Crimson Tide with 58 receptions for 924 receiving yards and four receiving touchdowns.
On December 8, the Southeastern Conference announced the annual All-SEC first-team, second-team, and individual awards, as voted by the Associated Press. Jones was selected to the second-team All-SEC, and named as the SEC Freshman of the Year. His performance in his freshman year drew comparisons to NFL greats. ESPN.com reported, "This guy is a unique, rare prospect for the wide receiver position with his supreme blend of size, power, speed, and agility. He reminds us of a high school version of Michael Irvin, but at this stage Jones is more explosive and faster." An NFL scout put Jones in the same category as Arizona Cardinals receiver Larry Fitzgerald, who at the time was the second-leading receiver in the NFL.
2009 season
After experiencing what some writers called a "sophomore slump" during a slow first half to the season, Jones's production increased during the second half of the 2009 season. In a rivalry game against #9 LSU, Jones finished with four catches for 102-yards, including a 73-yard game-winning touchdown in Alabama's 24–15 victory. In the annual Iron Bowl game against rival Auburn, Jones helped in capping a come-from-behind victory, catching three third-down passes in an 8-minute, 80-yard drive that fans call "The Drive" to set up running back Roy Upchurch's game-winning touchdown in the waning minutes of the fourth quarter. Alabama continued through the regular season undefeated at 12–0, working their way to an SEC Championship matchup with the #1 Florida Gators. Jones made the first catch of the game, an 18-yard catch from McElroy. The Crimson Tide won the game 32–13, earning a chance to play for the BCS National Championship in the 2010 title game against the #2 Texas Longhorns. His 23-yards receiving led the Tide in the title game, as the passing game struggled. However, the running game again took over for 205 total rushing yards and led Alabama to a 37–21 victory.
2010 season
Jones started the 2010 season with two games going over 100 yards and three total touchdowns in the first seven games. On October 23, Jones did well against the Tennessee Volunteers, recording 221-yards on 12 receptions, in a 41–10 victory at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, Tennessee.  On November 18, against Georgia State, he recorded his first collegiate game with two receiving touchdowns in the 63–7 victory. On November 26, in the Iron Bowl against #2 Auburn, Jones had ten receptions for 199-yards and a touchdown, but the Crimson Tide lost to the Tigers by a score of 28–27. The Crimson Tide reached a bowl game, which was Jones's final collegiate game. In the 2011 Capital One Bowl against Michigan State, Jones had three receptions for 49-yards, 36 rushing yards, and a rushing touchdown in the 49–7 victory.
Jones ended his junior season with an Alabama record of 78 catches and 1,133 yards along with seven touchdowns (fourth in school history). In addition, he had eight rushes for 135 yards and two touchdowns along with five punt returns for 44 yards and five kickoff returns for 129 yards. Jones ended his Alabama career second in career receptions (179) and yards (2,653) in school history and fourth in touchdown catches (15). Jones had eight career 100-yard receiving games (second in school history). Jones was a first-team All-SEC selection in 2010.
Professional career
On January 7, 2011, Jones decided to forego his senior season. Instead, he chose to declare eligibility for the NFL Draft with teammates Mark Ingram, Greg McElroy, and Marcell Dareus. Jones was later invited to the "All-Star Football Challenge", a skill contest shown by ESPN on February 4. At the 2011 NFL Combine, he posted the longest long jump and the third-fastest 40-yard dash among wide receivers, despite having a broken bone in his foot.
Atlanta Falcons
The Atlanta Falcons selected Jones with the sixth overall pick of the 2011 NFL Draft despite already having Pro Bowl receiver Roddy White. The Falcons traded five draft picks to the Cleveland Browns to move up into their spot and take Jones, giving up their 27th, 59th, and 124th picks from the 2011 Draft, and their first and fourth-round picks from the 2012 Draft. Due to the work stoppage at the time of the draft which prevented teams from using players in draft day trades, Falcons general manager Thomas Dimitroff found it difficult having to use only draft picks to trade up from the number 27th overall pick to the sixth overall pick. "We knew it was going to be an aggressive move and cost us," Dimitroff said. "As an organization we felt very strongly about the move for a player who truly adds the explosive, urgent athleticism we're looking for to improve on this team." He was the second wide receiver to be taken in the 2011 NFL Draft, behind only A. J. Green of the Georgia Bulldogs, who was selected fourth overall by the Cincinnati Bengals. In addition, he was one of five Alabama Crimson Tide players to be selected that year. Jones wore number 11 with the Falcons.
2011
Jones came to terms with the Atlanta Falcons on July 28, 2011, signing a four-year contract worth $16.2 million, all of which was guaranteed. His NFL debut came against the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field. In the 30–12 loss, Jones had five receptions for 71-yards. In Week 3 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Jones had six receptions for 115-yards in the Falcons 16–13 loss, his first game with 100+ yards. In Week 4, against the Seattle Seahawks, Jones had 11 receptions for 127-yards in the 30–28 victory. He recorded his first two receiving touchdowns on Week 9 against the Indianapolis Colts in a 31–7 victory. Jones's first touchdown was a 50-yard reception from quarterback Matt Ryan in the first quarter, and the second touchdown was an 80-yard reception from Ryan in the second quarter. After having quiet games against the New Orleans Saints and the Minnesota Vikings, and being inactive during a game against the Tennessee Titans, Jones bounced back against the Houston Texans with four receptions for 68-yards in the 17–10 loss. The following week, Jones had another strong game with three receptions for 104-yards and two touchdowns of 75-yards and 17-yards respectively, both of his touchdowns were in the 4th quarter, allowing the Falcons to close out a 31–23 victory against the Carolina Panthers. Over the last three games of his season Jones recorded games of five receptions for 85-yards and a touchdown, eight receptions for 128-yards and a touchdown, and four receptions for 76-yards and two touchdowns. Overall, in 13 games played, Jones finished his rookie season with 393 receiving yards and six touchdowns over the last four games of the regular season. He finished the season leading all rookies in touchdown receptions with eight, while his 54 receptions for 959 receiving yards ranked him second among rookies in yards, behind A. J. Green of the Cincinnati Bengals and third in catches behind Green and Greg Little of the Cleveland Browns. Jones was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team for the 2011 season. The Falcons made the playoffs with a 10–6 regular season record to earn the #5-seed in the playoffs. In his playoff debut, Jones had seven receptions for 64-yards in a 24–2 Wild Card Round loss to the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Giants.

On October 25, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Jones had six receptions for 147-yards and an 80-yard touchdown reception in the 24–23 victory in Week 12.

The Falcons finished the season with a 13–3 regular season record and earned the top seed in the NFC for the NFL playoffs. In the Divisional Round against the Seattle Seahawks, Jones recorded his first career interception on the last play of the game defending a Hail Mary pass attempt from quarterback Russell Wilson. In addition, he recorded six receptions for 59-yards in the 30–28 victory. In the NFC Championship against the San Francisco 49ers, Jones had 11 receptions for a then career-high 182-yards and two touchdowns in the 28–24 loss. In the 2012 regular season, Jones had 79 receptions for 1,198 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns, his first season going over 1,000 receiving yards and setting a career high in single-season touchdown receptions. As a result, he was selected for the 2013 Pro Bowl, which was his first Pro Bowl nomination. Jones and fellow wide receiver Roddy White were the first 1,000-yard receiving tandem the Falcons have had since 1998 (Tony Martin and Terance Mathis). He was ranked 26th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012.
2013 season: Injury-plagued season
Jones started the 2013 season with a relatively solid performance against the New Orleans Saints with seven receptions for 76-yards and a touchdown in the 23–17 loss. The following week, Jones had 11 receptions for 182-yards, including an 81-yard touchdown catch against St. Louis Rams. Over the next two games, Jones continued his hot streak with nine receptions for 115-yards against the Miami Dolphins and six receptions for 108-yard performance against the New England Patriots. However, on October 7, 2013, Jones fractured his foot in the Week 5 Monday Night Football loss to the New York Jets and was ruled to be out for the season. In that last game, Jones had eight receptions for 99-yards. Jones managed to finish 76th in receiving yards among 458 qualified players for the 2013 season, with 41 receptions for 580 yards and two touchdowns. If Jones had played a full sixteen-game season and kept up his average of 116 yards and 8.2 receptions per game, he would have totaled 1,856 yards off of 131 receptions, which would have led the league in both categories. The Falcons finished with a losing regular season record and failed to make the playoffs.
2014 season

On April 29, 2014, the Falcons accepted the fifth-year option of Jones's rookie contract, extending his obligations with the team through the 2015 season.
