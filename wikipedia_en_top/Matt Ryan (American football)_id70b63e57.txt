Matt Ryan (American football)
Matthew Thomas Ryan (born May 17, 1985), nicknamed "Matty Ice", is an American football quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Boston College, where he won the Manning and Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Awards as a senior, and was selected by the Atlanta Falcons third overall in the 2008 NFL Draft. A member of the Falcons for 14 seasons, Ryan holds several franchise records with the team including passing yards, passing touchdowns, passer rating, and wins.
Ryan made an impact in his first season by taking the Falcons to the playoffs, earning him Offensive Rookie of the Year. During his Atlanta tenure, he led the team to six playoff appearances and three division titles, while receiving four Pro Bowl selections. His most successful season was in 2016 when he was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) and led the Falcons to an appearance in Super Bowl LI. Ryan was traded to the Colts and became their starting quarterback in 2022.
High school career
Ryan went to William Penn Charter School in Philadelphia where he was a three-year starter and earned All-East honors from Larunt Lemming Prep Football Report. He captured All-Southeastern Pennsylvania accolades as a senior quarterback in addition to receiving All-City first-team honors in 2002 and second-team recognition in 2001. A three-time All-League selection, he threw for more than 2000 yards with 19 touchdowns as a senior, finishing his career by completing more than 52 percent of his pass attempts during all three seasons at the helm. Ryan played football, basketball and baseball while in high school and was named captain of all three teams his senior year. He was quarterback of the football team in 2002, played small forward on the basketball team, and was a pitcher and a shortstop on the baseball team.
Ryan says he was "mildly" recruited and began receiving scholarship offers as a sophomore. Some of the schools that offered him an athletic scholarship were Purdue, Georgia Tech, Temple, and Connecticut. After visiting Boston College during his junior year, he gave them his verbal commitment on August 14, 2002. His choices had come down to Iowa or Boston College. Ryan was looking for a university close to home and one that had a strong and competitive football program with a major emphasis on academics.
College career
2003–2004
Ryan began attending Boston College in 2003 and redshirted his first year with the team. Before the 2004 season, he was named the starting quarterback for Boston College due to an injury to Quinton Porter. He made his collegiate debut on October 2, 2004, against the UMass Minutemen and completed two of three passes for 16 yards in the 29–7 victory. He would not complete his first touchdown until November 20, 2004, against Temple, after throwing a 32-yard touchdown pass to Larry Lester. Replacing the injured Paul Peterson, he completed 9-of-15 passes for 121 yards in the 34–17 victory. He made his first collegiate start on November 27, 2004, in the final game of that season, completing 24 of 51 passes for 200 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions in a 43–17 loss against Syracuse. He also played against North Carolina in the Continental Tire Bowl. He completed one of his two passes for 13 yards in the 37–24 victory. Ryan also received the 2004 Freshman Male Scholar-Athlete award in the same year.
2005 season
At the beginning of the 2005 season, Ryan was named the second-string quarterback behind Quinton Porter. Porter had some success at the beginning of the year, including winning Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Week for his performance in Boston College's 28–17 win over Virginia. After a 30–10 loss to third-ranked Virginia Tech, coach Tom O'Brien finally went to Ryan for good in the fourth quarter of the next game against North Carolina State. In ten games, of which he started five, he completed 121 of 195 passes for 1,514 yards. He had eight touchdowns and five interceptions. He also rushed for five touchdowns and 94 yards. He started his first bowl game in the MPC Computers Bowl versus Boise State. He completed 19 of 36 passes for 256 yards and a career-best three touchdowns in the 27–21 victory to help Boston College finish with a #18 ranking in the final AP Poll.
2006 season
Ryan started 11 of the 12 games. He completed 263-of-427 passes for a conference-leading 2,942 yards, 15 touchdowns, and ten interceptions. In addition, he rushed for four touchdowns. He was All-ACC first-team and led the ACC in total offense (242.2 yards per game) and in passing yards (245.5 yards per game). He was named ACC Offensive Back of the week three times. He set career highs in completions (32 against Central Michigan) and passing yards (356 against Brigham Young). He led the team to a 9–3 record including double overtime wins versus Clemson and Brigham Young. He led the Eagles to a close 25–24 victory on December 26, 2006, in the Meineke Car Care Bowl against Navy in Charlotte, North Carolina. In the season opener against Central Michigan, Ryan sprained his ankle. Against Virginia Tech, Ryan broke his foot on the same leg. Despite these injuries, Ryan only missed one game (against Buffalo). His 57 pass attempts in the 2006 Wake Forest game tied Shawn Halloran's performance against Syracuse in 1985 and Frank Harris' performance against Army in 1968. For the school record, his 40 pass completions in the 2006 Wake Forest game broke the old school record of 37 by Harris in the game against Army in 1968.
2007 season
Ryan launched a website during his senior year called Mattyice.com, where fans and media had 24-hour access to his video highlights, updated biographical information, statistics and other information.
Before the season started, Ryan was named to the preseason All-ACC team. Boston College also hired a new coach: Jeff Jagodzinski, a longtime NFL assistant. Against Wake Forest, he completed 32 of 52 passes for 408 yards and five touchdowns in the 38–28 victory. He continued his hot streak versus Georgia Tech, going 30–of–44 with one touchdown and passing for a career-high 435 yards against the staunch Tech defense en route to a convincing 24–10 road victory. After this game, Ryan was suggested as a potential Heisman Trophy contender. Battling Virginia Tech through bad weather in Blacksburg, Virginia, Ryan led an amazing comeback for the Boston College Eagles, passing for two touchdowns with less than three minutes to play on October 25, 2007, including the game-winner with 11 seconds left to Andre Callender. However, Ryan's chances to win the Heisman fell sharply after he threw three interceptions in a 27–17 loss to an unranked 6–3 Florida State. However, with a strong performance against Clemson, his chances were raised substantially. Despite two consecutive ACC losses, Ryan and the Eagles found themselves with a trip to the conference championship on the line. Down 10–3 in the third quarter, he led the offense on a game-tying drive, hitting on key passes to Rich Gunnell, Andre Callender and Ryan Purvis, landing the Eagles at the Clemson two-yard line early in the fourth. James McCluskey finished the job from there, running it in to even the score at 10-apiece. Shortly thereafter, a Clemson turnover resulted in a Boston College field goal and a 13–10 lead for the Eagles. On November 24, against ACC rival Miami, Ryan surpassed Doug Flutie for the most passing touchdowns in a single season by an Eagle quarterback with 28 touchdowns, ultimately ending the season with 31. Despite these records, he struggled with throwing interceptions throughout the year, and finished with 19 (second most among college quarterbacks). His five touchdown passes in the 2007 Wake Forest game are one shy of the school record of six, held by Flutie in 1984 against North Carolina. For Boston College, it was their first 10-win regular season since 1940 and the first time they had achieved back-to-back 10-overall-win seasons in program history. He led the Eagles to extend the nation's longest bowl winning streak to eight with a 24–21 victory over Michigan State Spartans in the Champs Sports Bowl on December 28, Ryan threw three touchdown passes, two to Rich Gunnell and one to Jon Loyte. He finished the season with a conference-leading 4,507 passing yards, 31 touchdowns, and 19 interceptions.
Ryan earned various accolades for the 2007 season. He was named the ACC Offensive Player of the Year and the ACC Player of the Year. He was awarded the 2007 Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, given annually in the United States to the nation's most outstanding college football senior quarterback. The other finalists for the 2007 award were Hawaii's Colt Brennan, Louisville's Brian Brohm, Oregon's Dennis Dixon and Kentucky's Andre' Woodson (all of whom were drafted at the 2008 NFL Draft). He was selected to play in the 2008 Senior Bowl. He also won the 2007 Manning Award awarded to the nation's top quarterback, beating out eventual Heisman winner Tim Tebow and eight other finalists for that year's award: Erik Ainge (Tennessee), Sam Bradford (Oklahoma), Colt Brennan (Hawai'i), Chase Daniel (Missouri), Dennis Dixon (Oregon), Graham Harrell (Texas Tech), Pat White (West Virginia) and Andre Woodson (Kentucky). He was named "Eagle of the Year" alongside Boston College's first ever individual champion Kasey Hill. He finished in seventh place in the Heisman Trophy voting that year.
He was featured as the cover athlete for the PS3 version of NCAA Football 09. In 2016, Boston College retired his jersey.
Awards and honors
Professional career
Atlanta Falcons
Ryan scored a 32 on the Wonderlic exam, tying Louisville's Brian Brohm for the highest score by a quarterback in the 2008 Draft class.
He was drafted third overall by the Atlanta Falcons in the 2008 NFL Draft. He was the second first-round pick of the draft to sign when he agreed to a six-year, $72 million contract on May 20, 2008; the contract contained $34.75 million in guaranteed money. The contract made Ryan the fourth highest paid quarterback in the NFL behind Peyton Manning, Ben Roethlisberger, and Carson Palmer, despite never having played a professional game. This helped fuel the discussion regarding whether salaries for first-round draftees in the NFL were too high. In addition, Ryan had signed endorsement deals with Nike and AirTran.
2008 season
On August 24, 2008, Ryan was named the starting quarterback for the September 7 regular season opener against the Detroit Lions. Ryan became the first rookie quarterback to start a season for the Falcons since Michael Vick in 2001. In the game, Ryan completed his first NFL pass for a 62-yard touchdown to Michael Jenkins, becoming the first quarterback to throw a touchdown on his first career NFL pass since Michael Bishop of the New England Patriots in 2000. Ryan was sacked for the first time by Lions defensive player Dewayne White in his first win. The second game of the season against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers marked Ryan's first interception by rookie cornerback Aqib Talib and also by Sabby Piscitelli.
In Week 3 against the Kansas City Chiefs, he completed the then-longest touchdown pass in his career for 70 yards to Roddy White. The 70-yard touchdown pass to White was the longest pass completion for the Falcons since December 23, 2007, when Chris Redman threw a 74-yard touchdown pass. In the same game, Ryan completed passes to 6 different players. The following week, he threw for 194 yards and two touchdowns against the Green Bay Packers. His touchdown passes went to Roddy White and tight end Justin Peelle. The following week against the Chicago Bears, Ryan led the Falcons to a comeback win. With six seconds left he completed a 26-yard strike to Michael Jenkins that set Jason Elam up for the game-winning field goal as time expired. Ryan finished the game 22-of-30 for a then career-high 301 passing yards. He also had a key fourth-quarter touchdown pass to Roddy White. On Atlanta's first offensive drive, Ryan completed all five of his pass attempts for 57 yards en route to a Falcons field goal and a 3–0 lead. Ryan was named Diet Pepsi Rookie of the Week for his performance.
Ryan created an activity named "Folleyball" for NFL Play 60 at NFL Rush.com, published in October of that year.
On October 30, Ryan was honored as the NFC Rookie of the Month for October following an impressive string of games in which he led the Falcons to a 2–1 record. Ryan became the first player in Falcons franchise history to be awarded this honor In Week 8 against the Oakland Raiders, Ryan finished with the highest completion percentage of his career (77.3). He threw for 220 yards, two touchdowns, and posted a quarterback rating of 138.4. He also completed passes to eight different receivers and the game was his third multiple touchdown game (Green Bay, Philadelphia). His first half passing yardage, completion percentage (81.3) and passer rating (154.2) are all career highs for a half and his two touchdowns tie a first half high, Ryan's final completion percentage of 77.3 is a career-high along with his passer rating of 138.4. He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week following his performance against the Raiders. He scored his first rushing career touchdown against the New Orleans Saints on December 7 with a 12-yard touchdown scramble, Ryan also achieved 3,000+ passing yards in the 2008 season being only the 2nd rookie to do so. Peyton Manning was the first.
Ryan became the first Falcons rookie quarterback in franchise history to throw for over 3,000 yards in a season after finishing with 206 yards against Tampa Bay. Ryan's passing total also makes him only the 10th quarterback in club annals to hit the 3,000-yard mark and the first since 1998 when Chris Chandler threw 3,154. It was also his first overtime win as a starter. He was named the Diet Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week for games played after his performance by the second time in his career. Ryan finished second amongst rookies in fan Pro Bowl voting (416,468 votes), behind only Titans running back Chris Johnson. Ryan threw for a season-low 134 yards in Week 16 against the Minnesota Vikings, ending a streak of nine straight games with at least 200 yards passing, he finished 13-of-24 passing, throwing an 8-yard touchdown passes to Jerious Norwood in the second quarter; however, with this win Ryan led the Falcons to their first playoff berth since 2004.
He finished the season with 3,440 passing yards, 17 touchdowns (one rushing), and 11 interceptions. He and fellow rookie Joe Flacco were the first rookie quarterbacks to lead their teams to the playoffs after starting all 16 games of the season. He is one of twelve rookie quarterbacks to throw for over 3,000 yards (2,743 m) in their rookie season. On December 31, Ryan was named the AP NFL Rookie of the Year. In addition, he was named to the All-Rookie Team for the 2008 season, joining Steve Bartkowski (1975) and Doug Johnson (2000) as the only Falcons quarterbacks to ever claim this award.
Ryan made his first playoff start in the Wild Card Round against the Arizona Cardinals on January 3, 2009. He was 15 years younger than opposing quarterback Kurt Warner, the third-largest age discrepancy between playoff quarterbacks. His first attempted playoff pass was an interception. Ryan completed 26 of 40 passing attempts for 199 yards and two touchdowns but was intercepted twice. He threw his first touchdown in a playoff contest to Justin Peelle. Atlanta lost, 30–24. Falcons Head Coach Mike Smith and Ryan became the first rookie head coach and rookie quarterback to coach and compete in a playoff game since the Cleveland Rams accomplished the feat with coach Adam Walsh and quarterback Bob Waterfield in 1945 (the feat was repeated the next day when Ravens Joe Flacco and John Harbaugh did so.) During the game, Ryan set an NFL playoff rookie record with 26 completions in a single postseason game.
2009 season
Ryan was voted by his teammates as Offensive Captain alongside offensive lineman Todd McClure at the end of the 2008 season.
In 2009, Ryan started off the season fast as he threw for 229 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions as he led the Falcons to a 19–7 win against the Miami Dolphins in the 2009 NFL season opener. In Week 2, Ryan led the Falcons past the Carolina Panthers. Ryan had a career-high in touchdown passes (3), completion percentage (78%) and touchdown passes in a half (3). He finished the game 21–28 with 220 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception. In Week 3, Ryan and the Falcons lost to the New England Patriots. Ryan completed 17–28 for 199 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions in the 26–10 loss.
In the Week 5 game against the San Francisco 49ers, he completed 15 of 21 passes for 258 yards in the first half, setting a new career-high for the first half of play. Ryan finished the 45–10 victory having completed 22 of 32 passes for 329 yards and two touchdowns for a 110.0 passer rating. Ryan tossed a 31-yard strike to Roddy White, and he connected to White again in the second quarter with a 90-yard touchdown. The pass and reception for Ryan and White set new career highs. The pass and reception also mark the third longest in franchise history and the longest pass play since 2001. The game was his third-career 300-yard passing outing as the second-year quarterback set a new career-high in total passing yards with 329 in a single game.
In Weeks 6 through 9, Ryan generally struggled, throwing more interceptions (8) than touchdowns (6), was sacked 10 times, and had an average passing rating of 65.5. Still, he led the Falcons to two victories in the four games, in part thanks to Michael Turner having some strong performances.
In Week 12, Ryan suffered a turf toe injury during a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Chris Redman stepped in and managed to win the game by connecting to Roddy White for a five-yard touchdown late in the fourth quarter. Following this victory, however, the effect of Ryan's absence was compounded by injury to starting running back Michael Turner, and the Falcons suffered a 34–17 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles and a 26–23 loss to the New Orleans Saints in Weeks 13 and 14. In Week 15, Ryan returned, despite not yet having fully recovered from his injury, and led Atlanta to a 10–7 upset win against the New York Jets.
In Week 16, the Falcons defeated the Buffalo Bills in a 31–3 win. Ryan threw for 250 yards with three touchdowns, two of them to Roddy White. In the last game of the season, the Falcons defeated the Buccaneers by a score of 20–10. In the win, Ryan had 223 passing yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions. With a record of 9–7, the Falcons attained back to back winning seasons for the first time in franchise history.
Ryan finished the season throwing for 2,916 yards with 22 touchdowns, 14 interceptions, and a quarterback rating of 80.9. Ryan also rushed for 49 yards and one touchdown.
2010 season
In the 2010 season, Ryan led the Falcons to an NFC best 13–3 record, second in the NFL behind the 14–2 New England Patriots.
Ryan's 2010 season started off slow in a 15–9 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was 27-of-44 for 252 yards and an interception. He bounced back in the next game against the Arizona Cardinals. In the 41–7 victory, he was 21-of-32 for 225 yards and three touchdowns. In Week 7, he had his most efficient game of the season in the 39–32 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. He was 24-of-33 for 299 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception for a season-high 118.1 passer rating. The victory over the Bengals was the start of an eight-game winning streak for Ryan and the Falcons. In Week 10, against the Baltimore Ravens, he passed for 316 yards and three touchdowns in the 26–21 win. After falling to the New Orleans Saints in Week 16, Ryan closed out the regular season with a 31–10 victory over the Carolina Panthers with 236 passing yards and two touchdowns.
On the season, Ryan set career highs in touchdowns (28), completion percentage (62.5), and yards (3,705) while tossing nine interceptions.

Ryan led the NFL in fourth-quarter comebacks for a quarterback in the 2010 season, with six.
In the Divisional Round, the Falcons were defeated by the eventual Super Bowl XLV champions, the Green Bay Packers, by a score of 48–21. In the loss, Ryan passed for 186 yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions.
Ryan was invited to the 2011 Pro Bowl, for the first time of his career. He threw two touchdowns in the Pro Bowl, one to Tony Gonzalez and the other to Larry Fitzgerald. He was named as the 52nd best player in the league on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.
2011 season
In the 2011 season, Ryan led the Falcons to a 10–6 record, passing for 4,177 yards, 29 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions.
In the season opener against the Chicago Bears, Ryan was 31-of-47 for 319 yards and an interception in the 30–12 loss. However, in the next game, the Falcons bounced back with a 35–31 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. Ryan was 17-of-28 for 195 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions. In Weeks 10 and 11, he recorded consecutive games with at least 300 passing yards in games against the New Orleans Saints and the Tennessee Titans. In Week 14, against the Carolina Panthers, he was 22-of-38 for 320 yards and four touchdowns in the 31–23 victory to his second career NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor. Ryan finished the 2011 season with 4,177 passing yards, 29 passing touchdowns, and 12 interceptions.
The Falcons' regular-season mark of 10–6 qualified them for the playoffs. However, they were defeated by the eventual Super Bowl XLVI champion New York Giants in the Wild Card Round by a score of 24–2. In the loss, Ryan was 24-of-41 passing for 199 yards.
2012 season
In 2012, Ryan led the Falcons to their franchise best start of the season, starting 8–0. Ryan set personal records in completions (422), completion percentage (68.6), yards (4,719), and touchdowns (32).
In the 8–0 start, Ryan posted four games with three touchdown passes and three games going over the 300-yard passing mark. The first loss of the season for the Falcons came in Week 10 against the New Orleans Saints. Ryan was 34-of-52 for a then career-high 411 yards and three touchdowns and one interception as the Falcons fell by a score of 31–27. In the next game against the Arizona Cardinals, Ryan threw for 301 yards but had a career-worst five interceptions. Despite the turnovers, the Falcons won by a score of 23–19. In the penultimate game of the regular season, he was 25-of-32 for 279 yards and four touchdowns in a 31–18 victory over the Detroit Lions to his third career NFC Offensive Player of the Week nod.
The Falcons finished the regular season 13–3, with the first seed in the NFC. Ryan, who was 0–3 in the postseason coming into the playoffs, won his first postseason game in the Divisional Round against the Seattle Seahawks, with Ryan orchestrating the final scoring drive that led to Matt Bryant's game-winning 49-yard field goal. Ryan finished with 250 passing yards, 68.6% completion percentage, three touchdowns, and two interceptions in the 30–28 victory. In the NFC Championship against the San Francisco 49ers, Ryan threw for 396 yards and three touchdowns, but also committed two turnovers in crucial portions of the game, and later sprained the AC joint to his non-throwing shoulder as the Falcons lost 28–24. He did not require surgical procedure to repair his shoulder and would have been able to play in Super Bowl XLVII if the Falcons had advanced. He was named to the Pro Bowl for the second time in his career, but he declined due to the shoulder injury. He was ranked #17 by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.
2013 season
On July 25, 2013, Ryan agreed to a five-year contract extension worth $103.75 million with the Falcons. On December 30, Ryan surpassed Steve Bartkowski for the all-time franchise leader in passing yards.
The Falcons had a down year, where they recorded a 4–12 record due to multiple injuries and losing key players on both sides of the ball. Ryan did record some impressive individual performances in the down season. In Week 2, against the St. Louis Rams, he had 374 passing yards and two touchdowns in the 31–24 victory. Against the New England Patriots in Week 4, he was 34-of-54 for a then career-high 421 yards with two touchdowns and one interception in the 30–23 loss. In his performance against the Patriots, Ryan became the first quarterback in franchise history to have multiple games with at least 400 passing yards. Against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 7, he was 20-of-26 for 273 yards and three touchdowns for a 148.4 passer rating in the 31–23 victory to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. After the victory, the Falcons were 2–4 with all the losses being by a combined 19 points. However, the rest of the season collapsed starting with five consecutive losses, which the team never recovered from. In Week 8, against the Arizona Cardinals, he had a career-high 61 pass attempts for 301 yards, one touchdown, and four interceptions in the 27–13 loss.
Overall, on the season, Ryan passed for 4,515 yards, which ranked fourth in the league, with 26 touchdowns and 17 interceptions.
2014 season
Ryan led the Falcons to a 6–10 record in 2014. He threw for 4,694 yards, 28 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions, and had a quarterback rating of 93.9.
The season did start off promising with a 37–34 overtime victory over the New Orleans Saints. Ryan was 31-of-43 for a then career-high 448 yards and three touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. After a 24–10 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, the Falcons defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers by a score of 56–14.

After a much-needed 29–18 win over the Arizona Cardinals in Week 13, the Falcons faced off against the Green Bay Packers and lost 43–37 as Ryan had 375 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception. After a 27–20 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers and a 30–14 victory over the New Orleans Saints, the Falcons had a 6–9 record. Despite the struggles of the 2014 season, the Falcons still had a chance to make the playoffs with a Week 17 victory due to the weakness of the entire NFC South division. However, the Falcons missed the playoffs for a second consecutive season after losing 34–3 to their divisional rivals, Carolina Panthers, in Week 17. For the third time in his career, Ryan was named to the Pro Bowl. He was ranked as the 77th best player in the league among his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.
2015 season
Ryan led the Falcons to an 8–8 record in 2015, good for second in the NFC South, but not enough to reach the playoffs.
The 2015 season was an inconsistent one for Ryan and the Falcons. In the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles, he was 23-of-34 for 298 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions in the 26–24 victory. In the next game against the New York Giants, he was 30-of-46 for 363 yards and a touchdown in the 24–20 victory. The Falcons won the next three games for a 5–0 start. Their first loss came in the sixth game with a 31–21 setback against the New Orleans Saints, where Ryan was 30-of-44 for 295 yards and two touchdowns. After a 10–7 victory over the Tennessee Titans, the Falcons dropped their next six games to send their season plummeting. In the losing streak, Ryan had a season-high 397 passing yards for two touchdowns and an interception in a 23–20 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 8 on November 1.
Ryan finished the 2015 season with 21 touchdown passes, the second-lowest of his career, as well as 16 interceptions, the second-highest of his career. Additionally Ryan fumbled a career-high 12 times, losing five of them, which was also a career-high.
2016 season: MVP season
The 2016 season was one of historically significant individual and team performance for Ryan and the Falcons. Ryan started off the 2016 season with 334 passing yards and two touchdowns in a 31–24 setback to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The next game, a 35–28 victory over the Oakland Raiders, he passed for 396 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception. In Week 4, Ryan threw for a team-record 503 yards and four touchdowns while teammate Julio Jones caught 12 passes for a team-record 300 yards and a touchdown in a win over the Carolina Panthers. Ryan and Jones were the first quarterback-receiver duo in NFL history to combine for at least 500 passing yards and 300 receiving yards in the same game. In October 2016, he set an NFL record for most consecutive games with at least 200 passing yards with 46 straight games. In Week 9, in the 43–28 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he had 344 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. In Week 17, in a 38–32 victory over the New Orleans Saints, he had 331 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.
Ryan improved greatly from the previous season. He threw for a career-high 4,944 yards on just 373 completions and 534 attempts, second in the league, and a career-high 38 touchdowns and a career-low seven interceptions, also second in the league. Ryan's 9.3 yards per attempt and 5.0 air yards per attempt ranked No. 1 among NFL quarterbacks in 2016. He threw a touchdown pass in all 16 games for the first time in his career and was the only quarterback to do so for the 2016 season. On the season, he threw a pass to an NFL-record 13 different receivers. Ryan was selected to his fourth Pro Bowl and was named First-team All Pro. Following the regular season, he was recognized as the NFL Most Valuable Player by the Pro Football Writers Association. Ryan was named the NFL Offensive Player of the Year and the NFL Most Valuable Player for the 2016 season. He earned the Bert Bell Award for the 2016 season. He was ranked tenth by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.

2021 season: Final year in Atlanta
With the departure of longtime teammate Julio Jones, Ryan struggled to find consistency in his first year with new head coach Arthur Smith. Ryan and Falcons started the season with a 1–3 mark. In Week 5 against the New York Jets, Ryan became the seventh quarterback in NFL history to reach 5,000 career completions. In the same game, Ryan surpassed Eli Manning for the 8th most all-time passing yards in NFL history. Following the victory over the Jets, the Falcons reached .500 with a win in their next game over the Miami Dolphins, with Ryan passing for 336 yards and two touchdowns. In Week 9 against the New Orleans Saints, Ryan had 343 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and one rushing touchdown in the 27–25 victory. Ryan was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance. The Falcons offense would be anemic in the next two games, as they were held to a field goal against the Dallas Cowboys and then were shut out by the New England Patriots, with Ryan held to less than 200 yards in both games. The Falcons alternated wins and losses going into Week 17.
During the Week 17 game against the Buffalo Bills, Ryan was called for a taunting penalty after seemingly scoring a rushing touchdown, but after further review, he was ruled down at the 1-yard line, and the resulting 15-yard penalty put Atlanta back at the 16-yard-line instead of being enforced on the ensuing kickoff. The Falcons failed to score from that distance on the next two plays, all but sealing a 29–15 loss that eliminated the team from the playoffs. Ryan finished the 2021 season with 3,968 passing yards, 20 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions.
Indianapolis Colts

2022 season

In Week 6 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Ryan finished with 389 passing yards and three touchdowns in the 34–27 victory, including throwing the game-winning touchdown to Alec Pierce with 17 seconds remaining. In the game, he passed Dan Marino for seventh all-time in passing yards. Following a Week 7 loss to the Tennessee Titans, head coach Frank Reich announced Ryan had a shoulder injury and Sam Ehlinger would be the Colts' starting quarterback for the remainder of the 2022 season. However two weeks later, Reich was fired and interim coach Jeff Saturday announced Ryan would return as the team's starter. In a 25–20 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, Ryan threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Parris Campbell with five minutes remaining, on a drive which included a career-best 39-yard run by Ryan to convert a third down. In a game against the Minnesota Vikings, Ryan and the Colts jumped to a 33–0 lead at halftime before having a historic collapse, allowing the Vikings to make the largest comeback in NFL history and win 39–36 in overtime. Ryan finished with 182 yards and a touchdown in the game. Following this loss, Saturday announced that Nick Foles would be the starting quarterback for the last three games of the season and that Ehlinger would be his backup, placing Ryan on the third string.
