Personal life
Lauren Elizabeth Jackson, whose nicknames include "Loz", "Jacko" and "LJ", was born in Albury, New South Wales, on Monday, 11 May, 1981, the oldest of two children of Gary Jackson and his wife Maree Bennie. Both her parents played for Australia's national basketball teams and Jackson inherited her height from both parents. Her father, Gary, played for the Boomers in 1975, while her 6ft 2in mother, Maree, played for the Opals from 1974 to 1982. Bennie played in two World Championships, and for the women's basketball team at Louisiana State in the late 1980s, wearing the number 15, the number Jackson wears in her mother's honour. Bennie was one of the first Australians to play in the American collegiate system, where she was known for her aggressive style of play and was nicknamed "the assassin". Her parents continued to play basketball locally on the social level when Lauren and her brother were young, and her family had a basketball court in their backyard when Jackson was growing up. Her grandfather played for the Western Suburbs Magpies.
Jackson grew up in Albury, where she attended Murray High School. She earned her Higher School Certificate in Canberra while she was training with the Australian Institute of Sport. Jackson studied for a psychology degree at Lomonosov Moscow State University and continued via correspondence from America. In 2007, she was working on a university course in business management.
In 2010, she was taking classes at Macquarie University in Sydney. Her coursework was centred in cultural studies and included topics like women's rights and racism. Injuries have prevented her from studying around 2010, but in 2012, she was back working on her degree, and her aspirations have included becoming a United Nations diplomat. She has also considered becoming an advocate for women. Her interests regarding gender studies were inspired by a book regarding the rape during the Rwandan Genocide, and Jackson is even an ambassador of a foundation that seeks to empower the abused women of that war. By 2015, Jackson was trying to get a Bachelor of Gender and Diversity at the University of Canberra, mostly through distance education.
As a youngster, Jackson was active in other sports. She was involved in athletics at school and played tennis, which she gave up because competitions conflicted with her ability to play basketball. Similarly, she played on her school netball team, until the age of 14, giving it up because of basketball commitments. In the off season, Jackson trains by pumping weights.
Jackson is 195 cm (6 ft 5 in) tall. She was this tall by the time she turned 16, after she gained 15 cm (5.9 in) in height when she was 15 years old.
Jackson's first child, Harry Gray, was born in 2017. She had a second child in 2018.
Basketball
Lauren is the most famous basketball player in Australia, a position she reached by 2003. Prior to this, Australia's most famous player was Michelle Timms, who played internationally. She was recognised as one of the world's best basketball players by the time she was 21. She has been described as Australia's best female player to ever step on a basketball court, and the best female basketball player in the world. She has said regarding being the best female basketball player in the world: "I don't really think about it. Nobody really talks to me like that. It's not something I'm conscious of. My family and people who have known me all my life, they see me for who I am, and crack open a beer or a bottle of wine with me. They know I have to train, but the rest of it is really laid-back."
Jackson plays two positions, forward and centre, and has the ability to make jump shots and spinning bank shots.
Early career
Jackson started playing basketball at the Albury Sports Centre when she was four years old. As a six-year-old, she told others that she would one day play for the Australian national team in Basketball. Her mother taught her how to play. She first played competitive basketball as a six-year-old she played on a local under-10 side. Her mother was her coach for two years. This was difficult for both mother and daughter in order to change their personal dynamics. As an 11-year-old, Jackson was not the best player in Albury, but she played in the under-14 Australian Country Championships. Her team made it to the Grand Final one year, and she played in the match despite having hurt her knee. She was upset after the event. In response to this, her parents sat down with her and explained she did not need to continue to play if she did not want to. Following this conversation, she went to her room and typed a message on her computer that said "from this day on, nothing will stand in my way..."
When she was 14 years old, Jackson led her New South Wales side to a national championship gold. Her performance in the tournament attracted the attention of the national team selectors. Tom Maher said of the game: "Right then and there, I said, 'Is this the best thing I've ever seen?' It was just unbelievable. Those old guys had seen a lot of basketball, and they were drooling." As a competitor at the 1999 Australian Under-20 national championships, she won the Bob Staunton Award for the tournament MVP. She was described as a basketball prodigy by the time she was seventeen years old.
Jackson has played with Robyn Maher, Michelle Timms and Shelley Gorman, whom she admired during her youth. They all won bronze medals at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Jackson had a rivalry with American basketball player Lisa Leslie. Both women dislike each other, a dislike that goes back to when Jackson was on tour in the United States with the Opals as a 16-year-old. The rivalry intensified in 2000 at the Olympics in the gold medal match when Jackson purposely pulled off Leslie's hair extension while both were trying to grab a rebound. Jackson treated the incident as a joke, saying "It was something to joke about even though we lost the gold medal." Leslie did not feel the same way about the extension pulling incident. The rivalry continued when Jackson transitioned to the WNBA and her Seattle Storm team played Leslie's Los Angeles Sparks, who at the time were the best team in the league. The rivalry was so intense that their coaches had to coach around it, sometimes choosing to keep one off the floor when the other was on. The coaches feared if they left the players on the floor together, their own player would foul out in an attempt to get the best of the other player. Leslie and Jackson have played together as team members in the WNBA's All-Star game. Their rivalry thawed somewhat by 2007 but they did not become friends.
Women's Korean Basketball League
In 2007, Jackson played in the Women's Korean Basketball League and was named the league's Most Valuable Player. She played for Samsung Bichumi (Samsung Insurance) in Seoul, South Korea. Her stint with the team was only four months, and she was the only international player on the team. She averaged 30.2 points per game. No one else on the team spoke English. Jackson claimed this allowed her to play drama free basketball. In a game with Samsung Bichumi against the Kumho Redwings, she scored 56 to set a league record in her team's 96–76 victory. This was a personal best for her in her career. Two weeks prior to the 56-point record, she scored 47 points in a single game. She competed in the league's all star game and was declared the Most Valuable Player of the match. She played two games a week with the league.
European basketball
Jackson has played club basketball in Europe. She first signed with a European side at the end of the 2005 WNBA season, and went to Russia on a lucrative contract. In 2007, she was paid six figures in American dollars, four times her WNBA base salary, to play with WBC Spartak Moscow Region for one month. Her teammates included other international basketball Olympians: Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi, and Tina Thompson. While playing for the team, she lived in a mansion owned by the team's owner with a view of a nuclear power plant. As a member of the team, she helped Spartak win the 2007 Russian Superleague title. Subsequently, she continued playing for Spartak and won two more Russian Superleague titles with the team, in 2008 and 2009. She scored 35 points in a EuroLeague Women 2008 in an 11 April 2008 game against UMMC Ekaterinburg while playing for Spartak. This was the highest number of points that she scored in a single game in a Euroleague game. Later on, Jackson played for Spartak in the EuroLeague Women finals in Brno, which her team won. She finished the 2008 season with an average of 23.6 points per game and 7.1 rebounds per game.
In 2009, Jackson had an option of extending her contract with Spartak for two more years. First, it looked likely that Jackson would stay with Spartak. However, following the assassination of Shabtai Kalmanovich, the owner of the team, she announced in November 2009 that she would stop playing for the team and not extend her contract She subsequently changed her mind and returned to play with the Spartak in 2010. In the 2009/2010 season games she averaged 15.2 points per game and 5.7 rebounds per game. On 3 December 2010 while playing with Spartak, she was named the EuroLeague Women Player of the Week. Playing in the team's second match against a Kaunas Lithuanian side, she scored 28 points, had two blocks and had five rebounds while playing 31 minutes to lead her team to victory after having missed the first game where her team lost.
In the 2010/2011 season, Jackson played for Spartak, where she averaged 17.3 points per game and 8.4 rebounds per game. She left the team in early January 2011 because of an injury, returning to Australia for her recovery. Part of her treatment involved getting an MRI. According to Jackson, she left Russia for Australia because "I couldn't move, the swelling was very obvious, and the pain was just a little bit too painful. That's when I got home to all these messages and e-mails from people back in Australia who had seen the scans and said 'you need to come back (to Australia) and start your rehab right away'."

Casares plays in the Spanish Liga Femenina and the EuroLeague Women. After a February 2012 game, her Spanish team's general manager Carme Lluveras described her performance as perfect. She has not started all games in the 2011/2012 season, coming off the bench on a few occasions because her team was stacked with talent. She was averaging 20 minutes, 8.0 points, and 2.9 rebounds a game as of 10 February 2012. During the 2011/2012 season, she scored 14 points against Bourges, 15 points in an away game against UMMC Ekaterinburg, and six against Galatasaray at a home game. In the game against the Turkish Galatasary, she scored an important three-pointer near the end of the game that helped stop a come-from-behind attempt by the opposition.

With Jackson leading a side composed of the best 16- to 17-year-old development players in the country, the Australian Institute of Sport WNBL team won the WNBL Championship.
Jackson joined the Canberra Capitals for the 1999 season when she turned 18, and played with the team off and on until 2006. While with the team, she won four WNBL championships. In 1999/2000, the Canberra Capitals who won the league championship in a finals match against Adelaide where they had a final score of 67–50.
She played for the Canberra Capitals for the 2002/2003 season. In a November game in Penrith with a temperature of 40 °C (104 °F) against the Sydney Flames, 500 people largely showed up to watch her play. This season, she was coached by Carrie Graf. In the Penrith game, she scored 9 of the Capital's first 13 points. She finished the game with 29 points, 16 rebounds and 5 blocks, with her team winning 79–67. In a December 2002 against the Australian Institute of Sport, she scored 33 points. After home games in Canberra, Jackson would hang out with her teammates at Tilley's Devine Cafe.
In a December 2002 game against the Townsville Fire in Townsville was moved to the Townsville Entertainment and Convention Centre, which seated 5,000 people instead of at the Fire's normal 800-seat stadium, because it was felt Jackson would draw that large a crowd. She did, with 4,110 people showing up to the game and setting a regular season attendance record for the Fire. Canberra lost the match, with Townsville figuring a way to contain Jackson, limiting her to 23 points, which was six below her average of 29 points per game so far in that the season. At the time, the attendance was the best ever for a regular season WNBL game, with only two Grand Finals games in the post season having more people in attendance.
In the 2002/2003 season, she was one of only three players who were taller than 190 centimetres (75 in). She played with the Capitals in the Women's World Cup 2003 where she averaged 30.6 points per game and 11.4 rebounds. She also won the WNBL Grand Final as a member of the Capitals, and was named the Most Valuable Player in the Grand Finals match. During the 2003/2004 season, she scored 48 points in a single October 2003 game. This was her highest individual game point total at the time and is her single highest WNBL point scoring game.
Jackson returned to the Capitals for the last half of the 2009/2010 season. The Capitals started an effort to re-sign Jackson, and in March 2011, she signed a contract for a million dollars to play in the WNBL. This was the most an Australian woman had ever been offered to play for a domestic side in the country, with most of the top women earning only $50,000 a year. Despite returning to Australia and being present at every Capitals game, injuries prevented Jackson from playing in the 2012–13 NBDL season. For the 2013–14 season, the Capitals missed the deadline date to sign Jackson and led her to play in China instead. Jackson was signed for the Capitals' next two seasons, and expected to join the team in November 2014, after recovering from a hip surgery she went through in September. Jackson's return happened in 19 December against the Adelaide Lightning. Jackson managed to play five more games in the 2014–15 WNBL season, losing only one as she averaged 13 points and seven rebounds. Still her physical ailments prevented Jackson from training with her teammates, and requiring weekly drainings of synovial fluid out of her knee. During a double-header road trip in Victoria, Jackson's knee gave in. A subsequent MRI scan showed further damage to her knee that required new surgeries, forcing Jackson to sit out the rest of the season. The Capitals released Jackson from her contract in January 2016.
China 2013
After missing the 2013 WNBA season and with a deal with Canberra Capitals falling through, in September 2013 Jackson signed with the Heilongjiang Shenda of the Women's Chinese Basketball Association. She helped Heilongjiang qualify to the playoffs with an average of 22 points, 9.5 rebounds and 1.8 steals per game, but a heel injury made Jackson lose the post-season. Another injury during the season, where Jackson "pulled my meniscus out of the root of my bone" was not deemed too grave at the time, but the knee problems would escalate during the following years.
National team
Jackson made the Australian under-20 team when she was only 14 years old. She was first called up to the senior national team when she was 16 years old. Her national team coaches Tom Maher and Carrie Graf say positive things about Jackson to the press and others but they rarely have said those things to Jackson. This is a strategy designed to help motivate Jackson to play better. Tom Maher who was the coach her called her up said "She's so good she could be the greatest sportswoman in the world. She's that extraordinary." Graf has described Jackson as one of the superstars of the game.
Jackson was a member of the 1997 Australian Junior Women's Team that won a silver medal at the World Championships in Brazil. At the time, she was 16 years old. She averaged 14.3 points per game and 9.9 rebounds per game. She was also a member of the 1998 Australian Senior Women's Team that won a bronze medal at the World Championships in Germany. At the time, she was 16 years old and the youngest Australian woman ever to be named to the team. In the tournament, she averaged 10.9 points per game and 3.9 rebounds per game. She was a key part of the team's success. She was coached in the tournament by Tom Maher. She came off the bench to play.
In the Olympic test tournament in the lead up to the 2000 Summer Olympics, Jackson scored 18 points and 10.7 rebounds per game. She was a member of the 2000 Summer Olympics team that won a silver medal. At the 2000 Games, she scored 127 total points, had 23 total blocked shots, 12 steals and 67 rebounds. She averaged 15.9 points and 8.4 rebounds per game. In the 76–54 loss in the gold medal game, she scored 24 points and had 13 rebounds. She led the team in points scored and total rebounds. Going into the Olympics, her team was ranked third in the world. At the Sydney Games, she was coached by Tom Maher. The gold medal final was against the United States.
Jackson was a member of the Australian Senior Women's Team that won a silver medal in the World Championships in China in 2002. She averaged 23.1 points a game in the competition and was named to the All-Star team for the tournament. She averaged 5.4 rebounds per game. In a semi-final match against the United States, Jackson fouled Lisa Leslie three times in the first six minutes of the game. The team lost while Jackson spent most of the time on the bench. By January 2003, Jackson had played over 100 games with Australia's senior side. She competed in the 2003 World Championships and was named the International Basketball Federation's Most Valuable Player. At the FIBA Diamond Ball Tournament for Women 2004, she averaged 22.7 points and 14.0 rebounds per game.
Jackson was a member of the Australian senior team that won a silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics, where she averaged 22.9 points and 10.0 rebounds per game. The gold medal final was against the United States. In 2006, she was a co-captain with Jenny Whittle of the Australian women's senior team that won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games. She played in the preliminary final against the Mozambique women's national basketball team, and the gold deal match against New Zealand. Jackson was the captain of the Australian women's senior team that won a gold medal at the World Championships in Brazil in 2006 that beat Russia in the Gold Medal match. This was the first time Australia had ever earned gold in the event. Jackson averaged 21.3 points and 8.9 rebounds per game. While the national team is called The Opals, Jackson asked Basketball Australia if they were to make rings for team members in honour of their win, if they would use diamonds instead of opals.
As captain of the 2008 Summer Olympics Australian women's team that won a silver medal at the Olympics, Jackson averaged 17.3 points and 8.6 rebounds per game. In the FIBA Diamond Ball Tournament for Women 2008, Jackson averaged 20.3 points per game and 5.0 rebounds per game. In 2010, she was a member of the senior women's national team that competed at the World Championships in the Czech Republic. She averaged 13.4 points per game and 7.9 rebounds per game.
Jackson missed the first training camp for the 2012 Summer Olympics squad in March, but was back by April to train with the team. In June, Jackson tore her adductor magnus muscle during the Australian training camp in the Czech Republic. She was one of the models for the 2012 Australian Olympic team uniforms, and chosen to carry the Australian Flag during the Opening Ceremony for the 2012 Olympic Games. The hamstring injury prevented Jackson from getting much play during the Olympic tournament, having only had significant court time in the matches against USA and the bronze medal play-off with Russia.
After flying to Australia in February 2014 to operate on her heel and knee, Jackson committed to return to the Opals in time for the 2014 FIBA World Championship for Women. However, the delayed recovery of Jackson's knee led her to give up on the tournament to have her right hip operated on to fix a torn labrum in September 2014. She had gotten the tear while playing for Ros Casares Valencia in 2012 but went without surgery to not miss the then-upcoming Olympics. Jackson would later express interest in attending her fifth Olympic tournament during the 2016 Summer Olympics as a way to close her career, while also pursuing her long-standing dream of a gold medal. However, while attending the Opals training camp in Canberra, she announced her retirement saying her conditions were not improved enough and she needed an "absolute miracle" to get into shape.
In April 2022, Jackson came out of retirement at the age of 40, to play for the Albury Wodonga Bandits in NBL1 East. That August, she was named to the Australia squad for the 2022 FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup, to be held from 22 September–1 October in Sydney. Australia went on to win the bronze medal, with Jackson recording 30 points and 7 rebounds in their victory over Canada.
Post-retirement
After retiring in 2014, Jackson had previously expressed interest in becoming a basketball administrator, saying that "Where I put my time and energy is now crucial. I want to get involved in the political side of sport rather than the media and I need to learn from the people who have been there before." She now heads the women's division of Australian Basketball Alliance, a new trade union for basketballers formed in 2015. A main pursuit of hers is getting tertiary education for all players. In May 2016, Jackson joined the new ownership group of the Melbourne Boomers, being named the team's commercial operations executive. Jackson also served as a colour commentator for Channel Seven's broadcast of the Olympic tournament.
Jackson has a son, Harrison "Harry" Gray Jackson, who was born on 2 February 2017. She released an autobiography, My Story: A Life in Basketball and Beyond, in October 2018, and while promoting it revealed she was pregnant with her second child.
Health issues
Jackson has had multiple injuries. In 2008, after the Olympics, she had surgery to fix her ankle. In 2009, she had two stress fractures in her back. In December 2010, she had an Achilles injury. She sustained the injury playing in Australia. Between January 2011 and February 2012, she had surgeries to assist with Achilles and hip injuries. She had surgery on her left hip acetabular labrum in June 2011 in Vail, Colorado at the Richard Steadman Clinic. She said of the surgery: "This is a really, really tough decision, but after talking with my doctors and my family, we felt that immediate surgery is the best course of action. With something painful like this hip injury, I want to be especially proactive. I plan to stay in Seattle to be here with my team and try my best to be back on the court as soon as possible. My goal is to be at full strength by the end of the season." She did rehabilitation twice a day in an attempt to speed her recovery. Afterwards, Jackson injured her right knee, requiring more surgery in 2012. Another knee injury while playing in China in 2014 degraded into arthritis, and her knee required much surgical intervention during the following years, including a long hospitalisation in January 2016 after her knee joint suffered a postsurgical infection. All the consequences of this knee problem led to Jackson's retirement from pro basketball in March 2016.
Jackson has expressed interest in undergoing a knee reconstruction, as "I don't want to walk with a limp for the rest of my life."
Celebrity
By 2003, Jackson was being recognised around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not one of my best points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." She does not like to go out to clubs because she gets recognised by too many people, and everyone wants to comment on her height. She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30 am any more because she lacked the stamina.
In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Yao were romantically involved. These rumours were incorrect. Jackson said of them: "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7-foot 6 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [differences] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [because of the loss and surgery]. I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time."
When people google Jackson, some of the first search results feature her in the nude. Jackson said of this: "Instead of being known for my basketball skills, all of these nudie shots are always the first thing you see." She posed nude in an Australian magazine, Black+White, that featured Olympic athletes who were set to compete in Athens in the 2004 Summer Olympics. The expensively printed magazine/book has been produced for the last three Olympic Games and, by the 2004 edition, was considered uncontroversial in Australia with its "artistic" approach to nude photography, and its equal coverage of male and female athletes, although it did create a stir in the United States. She also posed for the 2005 edition of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. Of posing nude, she said, "if offered the opportunity, I think that it's a personal decision. Whether you do it for the money or whatever, again, I think it's a personal decision. I don't know whether I would say yes or no. I guess you cross that bridge when you come to it. I don't think it's a bad thing, I'm not against it."
As Jackson got older, she took on a more activist role, working for domestic violence charities and helping children from Australia's outback get involved in sport. In December 2002, she helped launch the Smith Family Toy Drive at the Canberra Centre with the help of Ainslie school children. She is the patron for the NSW Rape Crisis Centre. She is passionate about preventing domestic abuse. In 2010, she visited young basketball players at Batemans Bay's Moruya Basketball.

Jackson was named the Australian International Player of the year in 1999, 2000 and 2002. In 2005, she was inducted into the Australian Institute of Sport 'Best of the Best'. In late 2011, the Albury Sports Stadium was renamed the Lauren Jackson Sports Centre. A thousand people showed up at the renaming ceremony, at which Jackson was the guest of honour.
