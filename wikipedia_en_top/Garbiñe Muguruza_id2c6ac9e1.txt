She finished the year ranked at career-high rankings of world No. 21 in singles and No. 16 in doubles.
2015: First Grand Slam final & top 10 in doubles, WTA finals debut
Muguruza's first event of the year was to be the Brisbane International but she was forced to withdraw from the event due to an ankle injury. The following week, Muguruza chose not to defend her title at the Hobart International and competed at the Sydney International instead, where she reached the quarterfinals, defeating Agnieszka Radwańska for the first time in her career en route.

—2013 Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli, on Muguruza after her semifinal win over Agnieszka Radwańska at the 2015 Wimbledon Championships
Muguruza made a poor start into the grass-court season, losing in the first round of the Birmingham Classic and the third round of the Eastbourne International after a first-round bye. However, she and Suárez Navarro won their first grass-court doubles title in Birmingham, defeating Andrea Hlaváčková and Lucie Hradecká in straight sets in the final. At the Wimbledon Championships, Muguruza defeated tenth seed Kerber in the third round, 5th seed Caroline Wozniacki in the fourth round, 15th seed Timea Bacsinszky in the quarterfinals and 13th seed Agnieszka Radwańska in the semifinals to advance to her maiden major final.

After the tournament, Muguruza entered the top 10 for the first time, moving up to world No. 9 in the rankings.
During the US Open Series, Muguruza did not enjoy much success, dropping her opening matches in Toronto and Cincinnati to qualifiers Lesia Tsurenko and Yaroslava Shvedova respectively. At the US Open, she recorded her first win at the tournament by defeating German Carina Witthöft in the first round. However, she fell short to Johanna Konta in the following round in three sets, the match was a total time of 3 hours and 23 minutes, the longest women's singles match in that tournament's history since the introduction of tiebreaker in 1970.
Muguruza kicked off the Asian swing at the Pan Pacific Open where she advanced to the last eight after defeating Barbora Strýcová before losing to eventual finalist Belinda Bencic, in straight sets. At the Wuhan Open, Muguruza cruised into her second straight quarterfinal at the event after dispatching Sloane Stephens and Ana Ivanovic. She then went on to defeat the likes of Anna Karolina Schmiedlova and Kerber to reach the final where she faced Venus Williams but was forced to retire in the second set with an ankle injury. Muguruza was able to crack the top 5 for the first time in her career after the tournament's conclusion. At the China Open, Muguruza breezed by Irina Falconi before going the distance against Mirjana Lučić-Baroni to advance to the quarterfinals. With the win, Muguruza qualified for the WTA Finals for the first time. She will be the first Spaniard to compete at the year-end championships since Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in 2001. She then beat Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Radwańska to advance to her maiden Premier Mandatory final. With her semifinal win over Radwańska, Muguruza reached a career high of world No. 4. She went on to defeat Bacsinszky in straight sets to claim her first Premier Mandatory title and her biggest title of her career.
Muguruza then traveled to Singapore for the 2015 WTA Finals, where she went undefeated in the round-robin play, beating Petra Kvitová, Angelique Kerber, and Lucie Šafářová. She then lost to eventual champion Agnieszka Radwańska in the semifinals. Muguruza also competed in doubles in Singapore, where she and Suárez Navarro reached the final. However, they lost to the No. 1 seeds, Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza.
2016: French Open champion and world No. 2
Muguruza started her year at Brisbane International, when she already had to retire in her first match of the tournament due to plantar fasciitis. Her next tournament was the Australian Open, where she ensured a spot in the third round with straight set wins over Anett Kontaveit and Kirsten Flipkens, but fell to Barbora Strýcová. At the Fed Cup, Muguruza helped in Spain's tie against Serbia with wins over Ivana Jorović and Jelena Janković.
At the Dubai Championships, Muguruza suffered another early loss as she fell to eventual semi-finalist Elina Svitolina. Her next tournament was the Qatar Open, where she reached first quarterfinal of the year, defeating Nao Hibino and Tímea Babos, but lost then to Andrea Petkovic in three sets. Next she played in Indian Wells Open, where she lost in her opening match against Christina McHale after receiving first round bye. At the Miami Open, she was close to being defeated in the opening match against Dominika Cibulková but survived in the final set. She reached the fourth round but lost to the Indian Wells and eventual champion Victoria Azarenka in two tiebreakers.
She kicked off the clay court season by participating the Fed Cup against Italy. She scored wins against Francesca Schiavone and No. 7, Roberta Vinci, to help Spain enter the World Group next year. She then played in Stuttgart Open. She reached her second quarterfinals of the season where she lost to Petra Kvitová. At the Madrid Open, she lost in the second round against Irina-Camelia Begu, despite serving for the match. She then went on to reach her first WTA semifinals of the season in Rome, after defeating top ten opponent Timea Bacsinszky in quarterfinals, but lost to Madison Keys in straight sets.
At the French Open, Muguruza turned her season around, unexpectedly capturing her first major title. She lost the first set against Anna Karolina Schmiedlová in her first-round match but won in three sets. After that, she easily reached her second major final without losing a set in the next five matches, including wins over former champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round, surprise quarterfinalist Shelby Rogers, and former runner-up Sam Stosur in the semifinals. In the final, she faced world No. 1, Serena Williams, in a rematch of the previous year's Wimbledon final, and won in straight sets for her maiden major title. She marked 14 straight sets won, after losing the first she played. With the title she rose to a career high No. 2 in the WTA rankings of 6 June 2016. She is also the first Spanish female player to win a major title since Sánchez Vicario in 1998. By winning, Muguruza became the second player of either gender born in the 1990s to win a Major title after Petra Kvitová first did so at the 2011 Wimbledon Championships.
Starting off the grass-court season, she played the Mallorca Open, where she as the top seed suffered a first-round exit to former Wimbledon semifinalist Kirsten Flipkens, in straight sets, marking the third tournament of the year where she lost in her first match played and her second consecutive loss to Flipkens on grass. Muguruza returned to grass for Wimbledon as the second favorite with the chance to usurp the top ranking from Williams while being heralded as the leader of the next generation, following Williams' recent slump in tournament finals. Though Muguruza won her opening match against Camila Giorgi in a high quality display, she was quickly upset by Jana Čepelová in the second round. Unable to defend her finalist points from the previous year, Muguruza regressed to world No. 3 at the end of the tournament. At the Rio Olympic Games, Muguruza arrived as one of the favorite players to win in the women's singles tennis event. She defeated Andreea Mitu of Romania and Nao Hibino of Japan to progress to the third round. However, she was defeated comprehensively by the eventual gold medalist Monica Puig of Puerto Rico. She was also in the mixed doubles tournament alongside Rafael Nadal, but withdrew at the decision of Nadal, who was already playing both the men's singles and doubles.
Muguruza did not have much success during the US Open Series, either. At the US Open, she suffered another second-round loss, this time to Anastasija Sevastova. She did not fare well during the Asian Swing, with early round losses at the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, the Wuhan Open, and the China Open in Beijing. The loss in Beijing was significant, because Muguruza was the defending champion, and she therefore dropped in ranking after the tournament. However, she still qualified for the WTA Finals. Muguruza was defeated in the round robin stage, her only win coming from a three-set match against Svetlana Kuznetsova. She ended the season ranked No. 7.
2017: Wimbledon crown and world No. 1
Muguruza started the season at the Brisbane International, being the No. 4 seed. She made a run to the semifinals after three-set wins over Sam Stosur and Daria Kasatkina, and a straight sets win over Svetlana Kuznetsova. She then retired in the first set of her semifinal match against Alizé Cornet due to injury. At the Australian Open, Muguruza beat Marina Erakovic, Samantha Crawford, Anastasija Sevastova and Sorana Cîrstea en route to her first quarterfinal at the tournament. She then lost to CoCo Vandeweghe in straight sets.
Muguruza then played the Fed Cup quarterfinals, where she beat Barbora Strýcová in three sets before losing to Karolína Plíšková. Spain ended up losing the tie 2–3. During the Gulf Swing, she beat Çağla Büyükakçay in Doha, before succumbing to Zhang Shuai in three sets. She then retired in her first match at Dubai against Kateryna Bondarenko, due to injury. At Indian Wells, Muguruza advanced to the quarterfinals, beating Kirsten Flipkens, 17-year-old Kayla Day, and Elina Svitolina en route. She then lost to world No. 3, Karolína Plíšková, in two tiebreaks. At Miami, she reached the fourth round and retired against Caroline Wozniacki after losing the first set due to illness.
Muguruza suffered early losses at the start of the clay-court season, losing in her opening matches in Stuttgart and Madrid to Anett Kontaveit and Timea Bacsinszky, respectively. She bounced back in Rome by reaching the semifinals, before she had to retire against Elina Svitolina in the first set due to a neck injury. Muguruza entered the French Open as the defending champion, where she reached the fourth round, losing to home favourite Kristina Mladenovic, in three sets. In that game against Mladenovic, Muguruza had to face an extremely unfavorable crowd as well, almost bordering on unsportmanship-like behavior, since most of her unforced errors were celebrated not only by Mladenovic but by the crowd too. As she left the court and was receiving an ovation from the crowd, she was seen shaking her head and demanding the crowd not to applaud, since they wanted her to lose. In the following press conference, when asked about the pressure she suffered from the crowd, she started to cry and had to quit the press conference for about five minutes before she came to resume her thoughts on the match. This prompted a huge reaction in the Spanish sporting press, with some making the comment that "The Suzanne Lenglen Court looked more like the Stade de France, and it was as if there was a football game going on and not a tennis match". Since she failed to defend her title, Muguruza fell from the top 10.
Prior to Wimbledon, Muguruza began her grass-court season at the Birmingham Classic where she beat Elizaveta Kulichkova, Alison Riske and CoCo Vandeweghe before losing in the semi-finals to eventual runner-up Ashleigh Barty. She followed that with a second round exit at the Eastbourne International, losing to Barbora Strýcová.
As the 14th seed, Muguruza reached the Wimbledon fourth round, beating Ekaterina Alexandrova, Yanina Wickmayer and Sorana Cîrstea. She then faced the previous year's runner-up and world No. 1, Angelique Kerber, eventually beating her in three sets. She then defeated 7th seed Svetlana Kuznetsova and then 87th-ranked Magdaléna Rybáriková, both in straight sets, to advance to her second Wimbledon final. There, she defeated 10th seed Venus Williams in straight sets, clinching her second major title, and became the first ever player to defeat both Williams sisters in major singles finals.
Muguruza started her hard court summer in Stanford, beating Kayla Day and Ana Konjuh before losing in the semifinals to Madison Keys. She next travelled to Toronto for the Rogers Cup, and recorded wins over Kirsten Flipkens and Ashleigh Barty. Muguruza lost in the quarterfinals to Elina Svitolina. Muguruza's next tournament was the Western and Southern Open in Cincinnati. She won two tough three set matches against Madison Keys and Svetlana Kuznetsova to make it to the semifinals. There she faced Karolína Plíšková, the world No. 1, to whom she had lost six times in a row. This time Muguruza turned the tables and won in two sets. In the final she played Simona Halep, dropping only one game in 57 minutes to capture the fifth title of her career. This also marked the first time in which she won multiple titles in one season.
Muguruza entered the US Open as a contender for the No. 1 WTA rankings. She beat Rybáriková in a rematch of the Wimbledon semifinal to reach the fourth round of the US Open for the first time, where she lost to Petra Kvitová in straight sets. Despite the loss, Muguruza rose to the No. 1 ranking after reigning No. 1 Karolína Plíšková's loss to CoCo Vandeweghe in the quarterfinals, and became the 24th woman to achieve the ranking. Muguruza and Rafael Nadal made Spain the first country since the United States 14 years ago to simultaneously top both the ATP and the WTA rankings.
In Tokyo, she lost to Wozniacki in the semifinals, winning only two games. She then lost in the quarterfinals of the Wuhan Open to Jeļena Ostapenko and retired in the first round of the China Open to Barbora Strýcová after losing eight of the first nine games. With Simona Halep advancing to the final of the event, Muguruza ultimately lost the No. 1 ranking. Shortly after, she was named WTA Player of the Year. Muguruza was seeded second at the WTA Finals and was drawn in the red group alongside Karolína Plíšková, Venus Williams and Jeļena Ostapenko. She won her first match against Ostapenko in straight sets before losing to Plíškova, winning two games in both sets. Muguruza then faced Williams for a place in the semifinals but ended up losing in straight sets. This loss ended her chances of gaining the year-end No. 1 ranking.
2018: Mixed results, out of top 10
Muguruza started the season at the Brisbane International, where she was the top seed. After receiving a bye into the second round, she faced Aleksandra Krunić, but was forced to retire due to cramping in the third set. Muguruza had served for the match in the second set, and the retirement marked the third straight year she had succumbed to injuries at Brisbane. Muguruza then took a wildcard into the Sydney International, where she was once again the top seed. After beating Kiki Bertens in the second round, Muguruza withdrew from the tournament due to continued physical problems.
At the Australian Open, she was the third seed, and was also in contention for the No. 1 ranking. In the first round, she beat French wildcard Jessika Ponchet, in straight sets. In the second round, Muguruza was shocked by the world No. 88, Hsieh Su-wei, in straight sets.

At the Miami Open, she reached the fourth round where she lost to eventual champion Sloane Stephens. The end of the tournament also marked the completion of Muguruza's temporary partnership with Martínez. Later that spring, she won the championship in Monterrey, Mexico, coming back from a set and a break down to defeat Tímea Babos in three sets in the final. The victory marked Muguruza's first title win since the 2017 Western & Southern Open.
Her clay-court season began with the Fed Cup World Group II Play-offs, where Spain was to face Paraguay. In her first match, Muguruza faced world No. 334 Montserrat González, winning in three close sets. Muguruza had served for the match in the second set and held a match point, but was forced into a decider. Muguruza's next singles match was against Verónica Cepede Royg, which she won in straight sets. The victory ensured Spain would remain in World Group II next season. Her next tournament was Stuttgart, where she was the No. 2 seed. In her first match against Pavlyuchenkova, Muguruza retired after the first set because of a back injury. She then played in Madrid where she lost in third round to Daria Kasatkina. In Rome, Muguruza had bye in first round and in second round she lost to Daria Gavrilova.

Cutting her tennis season short, in November, Muguruza climbed to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain.  She finished the season ranked No. 36.

Playing style
Muguruza is an aggressive all-court player, whose game is centered around her flat, powerful groundstrokes. Her groundstrokes allow her to take time away from her opponents and dictate baseline rallies, despite the fact that Muguruza may often refrain from going for the lines, or hitting outright winners. Retired tennis player Agnieszka Radwańska described Muguruza's playing style as being "very explosive, especially from every shot. So forehand, backhand, serve, return, everything is coming to you so fast." As a result of her high-risk game style, she typically accumulates large numbers of both winners and unforced errors, and her inconsistency is frequently discussed in the tennis community.
Muguruza's strongest groundstroke is her backhand, which is hit flat with relentless depth and power, consistently penetrating deep into the court, allowing her to hit backhand winners at will. Muguruza's forehand is also powerful, and is similarly hit flat, but has been noted for its inconsistency. Although she can hit forehand winners from any position on the court, her forehand is also responsible for the majority of the unforced errors she accumulates on court; as a result of this, opponents acquainted with her playing style frequently target her forehand. Under the coaching of Martínez, Muguruza's forehand has shown improvements, making the shot more reliable and less erratic. Her first serve is powerful, being recorded as high as 113 mph (182 km/h), allowing her to serve numerous aces in any match, and dictate play from the first stroke. Her second serve has been known for its inconsistency, with Muguruza typically committing a significant number of double faults in any given match. Her second serve has begun to show improvements whilst being coached by Conchita Martínez, meaning that doubles faults are becoming more infrequent; greater applications of topspin prevent opponents from attacking her second serve. Muguruza's inconsistencies on serve are balanced by her strong return game, with her being one of the most aggressive returners on the WTA Tour. She neutralises powerful first serves, and attacks short second serves, typically hitting a large number of return winners in any given match.
Despite previously being thought of a baseline player, Muguruza likes to approach the net, a technique devised under the tutelage of Sam Sumyk; this technique saw mixed results, however. After working with Martínez, Muguruza became more selective when choosing to approach the net, and improved her net game significantly – in her 2020 Australian Open match against Elina Svitolina, Muguruza made 16 net approaches, and won 14 of these net points. Since working with Martínez, Muguruza has shown improvements to her movement and stamina, allowing her to counterpunch effectively, blending offence and defence effectively, constructing points until she creates the opportunity to hit low-risk winners. Muguruza is known for her inconsistency, often losing matches to players ranked several players below her; this has been attributed to both her risky playing style, and an occasionally fragile mentality. Her mentality has improved since beginning to work with a sports psychologist in 2020. Muguruza's favourite surface is clay, where the high bounce and slower speed aid point construction; Muguruza has stated herself that "clay is my territory". Her game is aided by her ability to move and slide on clay, and her success on the surface reflected by her prowess at Roland-Garros, where she reached the second week every year from 2014 to 2019, and being crowned champion in 2016. Despite this, Muguruza has experienced her greatest success on hard courts, where she has won eight of her ten singles titles.
Coaches
She was coached by Alejo Mancisidor from 2010 to 2015, but she then hired Sam Sumyk in 2015. The relationship between Muguruza and Sumyk was volatile and stormy, and was noted for their frequent arguments. Muguruza split from Sumyk in 2019, and began working again with Conchita Martínez that November. Martinez previously coached Muguruza at 2017 Wimbledon, where she won the title.

Endorsements
Muguruza has been endorsed by Adidas for clothing, footwear, and apparel since 2012, and frequently wears the range designed by Stella McCartney. Throughout her career, Muguruza has been endorsed by Babolat for racquets, speficially using the Pure Drive range. She was named the ambassador for Mazda Spain in June 2014 and for BBVA bank in December 2014. Her other endorsement partners are Rolex, Evian, Jaguar Cars, Nivea, Beats Electronics, and Maui Jim.

Philanthropy
In June 2017, shortly before winning her first Wimbledon women's singles crown, Muguruza announced that she had become an Ambassador for the international education NGO Room to Read. Muguruza announced plans to help the organisation to grow its impact in two focus areas of early grade literacy and equal access to secondary education for girls.
