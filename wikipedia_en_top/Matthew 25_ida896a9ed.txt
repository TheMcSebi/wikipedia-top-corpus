Matthew 25
Matthew 25, the twenty-fifth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, continues the Olivet Discourse or "Little Apocalypse" spoken by Jesus Christ, also described as the Eschatological Discourse, which had started in chapter 24.
American theologian Jason Hood, writing in the Journal of Biblical Literature, argues that chapters 23 to 25 of the Gospel of Matthew form the fifth and final discourse in the gospel. In his reading, these three chapters together "uniquely infuse Jesus' distinctive teaching on discipleship, Christology, and judgment with the dramatic tension running throughout Matthew's plot".

Content
This chapter includes the parable of the ten virgins (verses 1-13) and the parable of the talents or minas (verses 14-30), both unique to Matthew, followed by notice of "the great and universal judgment at the end of this period", with its parabolic references to a separation of peoples "as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats" (verse 32). The final section (verses 31-46) is sometimes referred to as the "parable of the sheep and the goats".
Verse 14
This verse begins a new parable, that of the talents or minas. There is no reference to the "kingdom of heaven" in this verse or in the parable, but the words, which mirror verse 1, are added in the King James Version and some other English translations "for the sake of grammatical completeness".
