Toyota Prius V
The Toyota Prius v (for versatile), also named Prius α (pronounced as Alpha) in Japan, and Prius+ in Europe and Singapore, is a hybrid gasoline-electric automobile produced by Toyota introduced in Japan in May 2011, in the U.S. in October 2011, and released in Europe in June 2012. The Prius v was unveiled at the January 2011 North American International Auto Show alongside the Prius c Concept, and it is the first Prius variant to be spun off from the Prius platform. According to Toyota the "v" stands for "versatility". It is a compact MPV with a standard full hybrid drivetrain.
The Prius α was offered in the Japanese market with a nickel–metal hydride battery at a price of ¥2.35 million (US$29,000), and the lithium-ion battery version was expected to sell for ¥3 million (US$37,000).  The Prius v base price in the U.S. started at US$26,400 and was offered only with a nickel–metal hydride battery. As of April 2016, global sales totaled about 634,000 units, led by Japan with 428,400 units sold, representing 67.6% of global sales.
Specifications
The Prius v design resembles compact based minivans prevalent in Europe and has a drag coefficient of Cd=0.29 with a shape that evolved from the Prius. The exterior styling is rounded with an extended roofline that allows the vehicle to retain the triangular silhouette symbolic of Prius.  Other differences are the trapezoidal-shaped front with sharp-edged headlamps and wind-slipping aero corners for improved aerodynamics, as well as an enlarged under grille.  The rear styling has a specially designed roof spoiler that improves air flow.
The interior cargo space is more than 50% larger than the 2010 Toyota Prius, 5 inches (130 mm) longer and 1 inch (25 mm) wider, providing 34.3 cubic feet (970 L) of cargo space behind the rear seats; it also offers 38 inches (970 mm) of rear leg room, and more head height.
The Toyota Prius v includes many of the same standard features of the 2010 Prius, with four driving modes: Normal, Power, Eco and EV; smart key with push button start, an electronic shift lever, Hill Start Assist Control (HAC), and a back-up camera.  Available options include energy-efficient LED headlamps, dynamic radar cruise control with a Pre-Collision System (PCS), and advanced parking guidance system. The Prius v has several technical advancements including Toyota's new Toyota Entune Multimedia System and a panoramic sunroof made of lightweight resin, 40% lighter than a glass roof of the same size. Entune premiered on the 2012 Toyota Prius v.
Powertrain
The Prius v powertrain uses the same 1.8 liter Atkinson cycle gasoline inline-four engine used in the conventional Prius, a 60 kW traction motor, and shares the Prius's Hybrid Synergy Drive system and the same 201 volt nickel-metal hydride battery pack.
Toyota introduced some refinements unique to the Prius v powertrain. These refinements include a new "Pitch and Bounce" motor control that the Prius v automatically employs on undulating roads and the refined control was designed to improve ride comfort and control. Because the Prius v is a larger vehicle with greater load capacity, suspension components were redesigned to improve handling and ride quality. "Pitch and Bounce" control works with the vehicle's suspension to cancel longitudinal oscillation when the Prius v is driven over uneven surfaces.
The Prius v also includes a redesigned engine coolant heating structure surrounding the vehicle's catalytic converter and the exhaust heat recirculation system has been refined to reduce engine warm-up time and improve occupant heater response time in cold weather. A switch valve electronically controls coolant recirculation through the exhaust heat recirculation system.
Safety
In the United States the 2012 model year Prius v includes Toyota's Vehicle Proximity Notification System (VPNS), which is designed  to alert pedestrians, the blind, and others of the vehicle's presence due to significant noise reduction typical of a hybrid vehicle traveling at low speeds in EV mode. This type of warning device is mandated in the United States by the  Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010. The warning sound is generated by externally mounted speakers and it activates automatically only at speeds below about 15 mph (24 km/h). The pitch varies with the vehicle's speed to give pedestrians a sense of whether the approaching Prius is accelerating or decelerating. Reception for this feature of the car had been mixed, with the website Green Car Reports thinking it sounded like a "Deranged Spaceship".
Fuel economy and emissions
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the Prius v fuel economy at 44 miles per US gallon (5.3 L/100 km; 53 mpg‑imp) for city driving and 40 miles per US gallon (5.9 L/100 km; 48 mpg‑imp) for highway, and a combined rating of 42 miles per US gallon (5.6 L/100 km; 50 mpg‑imp). According to Toyota, the Prius v produces 66% less smog-forming emissions than the average new vehicle.
Under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test, the base model has a fuel consumption of 4.1 L/100 km (69 mpg‑imp; 57 mpg‑US) in combined cycle and 3.8 L/100 km (74 mpg‑imp; 62 mpg‑US) in city driving. Its CO2 emissions are estimated at 96 g/km. The top-of-the-line model has a fuel consumption of  4.4 L/100 km (64 mpg‑imp; 53 mpg‑US) and CO2 emissions of 101 g/km.
Markets and price
Toyota launched the second member of the Prius family with three regional versions of the vehicle: the Prius v in the North American market, the Prius α in Japan, and the Prius+ in Europe. The Alpha is the basis for the five-seat launched in North America, and the seven-seat released in Europe. A total of 186,989 Prius α/v/+ were sold worldwide in 2012, its first full year in the market. Global sales up to April 2016 totaled 634,000 units.
