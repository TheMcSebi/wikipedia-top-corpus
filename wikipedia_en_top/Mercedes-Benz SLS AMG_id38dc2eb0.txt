Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG
The Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG (C197 / R197) is a front mid-engine, 2-seater, limited production grand tourer developed by the Mercedes-AMG division of German automotive manufacturer Mercedes-Benz, with the assistance of David Coulthard. The car is the successor to the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren and was described by Mercedes-Benz as a spiritual successor to the Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing, mainly because it was inspired by the latter. SLS stands for "Super Leicht Sport" (Super Light Sport).
The SLS was the first Mercedes-Benz automobile designed and built from scratch entirely by AMG. Upon its introduction at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show, the SLS AMG's 571 PS (420 kW; 563 hp) M159 engine was according to AMG "the world's most powerful naturally aspirated production series engine" ever produced.
An electric version of the car, the SLS AMG Electric Drive, was presented at the 2012 Paris Motor Show. Production ended in 2014 with the introduction of the SLS AMG GT Final Edition.
As compared to its predecessor (the Mercedes-McLaren SLR), the SLS is per Mercedes-AMG head Tobias Moers, the faster car on the track, both in the hands of normal drivers as well as race car drivers. The Mercedes-McLaren SLR came in at 1,750 kg (3,858 lb). The SLS, however, has a curb weight of 1,619 kg (3,569 lb) when equipped with the standard wheels.
Design
The SLS AMG was designed  by Mark Fetherston to be a modern 300SL Gullwing revival from October 2006 to April 2007. The SLS AMG has also adapted the feature of the gull-wing doors that swing open upwards on gas struts, and must be closed manually as AMG engineers decided against the 41 kg (90 lb) of additional weight that auto-closing systems would have added to the car. In case of a roll-over, the doors can be fully detached to allow the occupants to leave the vehicle.
Although there is some overlapping in price and performance, the lighter SLS AMG is considered more of a sporty track-oriented car, compared to the Mercedes-Benz SL which is a grand tourer especially with its optional V12 engine. Compared to the SLS AMG Roadster, the SL is a hardtop convertible with technological and comfort amenities, and it also has available heated seats with a massage function.
The SLS AMG has won a number of design awards, including the 2010 red dot "best of the best" award, the iF product design award 2010 for the "Transportation Design" category, and the Auto Bild Design Award 2010 as "Europe's most attractive car". It is also the only automobile to have won the gold Design Award of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Production and sales
Body styles (production years)
The SLS AMG was assembled largely by hand, with its chassis and aluminum body shell produced by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria and then transferred to Sindelfingen, Germany for assembly, with its engine being hand built by AMG in Affalterbach, Germany.
The SLS AMG was officially introduced at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show, and sales commenced in mid-2010 in Europe and in mid-2011 in the United States.
Specifications
Engine
The 6.2-litre V8 engine (based on the M156 block) was modified to such an extent that AMG gave it a separate engine code—M159—to signify the more than 120 different modifications done to the engine (as well as the addition of a dry-sump lubrication system to handle the car's high cornering speeds).
Transmission
AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT 7-speed dual-clutch automatic is connected to the engine through a lightweight carbon fibre driveshaft in a transaxle arrangement. Selectable driving modes include "C" (Controlled Efficiency), "S" (Sport), "S+" (Sport plus) or "M" (Manual; allowing the driver to change gears via paddles present on the steering column behind the steering wheel). A true manual transmission is not available. All SLS AMG models except the SLS AMG Electric Drive use the DCT, with the Electric Drive using two single speed transmissions allowing individual distribution of torque to each wheel.
Brakes
Standard brakes are 390 mm (15.35 in) (front) and 360 mm (14.17 in) (rear) cast iron disc brakes with 6-piston aluminium (front) and 4-piston (rear) calipers. Optional on the SLS AMG are carbon-ceramic disc brakes. 402 mm (15.83 in) discs with 6-piston aluminium calipers (front) and 360 mm (14.17 in) discs with 4-piston calipers (rear). These brakes provide increased stopping power with a 40% weight reduction compared to the standard braking system.
Fuel consumption
The fuel consumption of the SLS AMG is around 13 L/100 km (22 mpg‑imp; 18 mpg‑US) combined driving (NEDC, provisional figure).
Performance
The SLS AMG is capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.8 seconds (manufacturer claimed), and can reach a top speed of 315 km/h (196 mph).  The sports car can also perform a quarter mile time of 11.7 seconds at 201 km/h (125 mph).
The SLS AMG achieves a lateral acceleration of 0.99, improving upon the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, which achieves a 0.97 figure.
Safety
In the June 2010 issue of Car and Driver magazine, safety specifications were revealed pertaining to the safety of the SLS AMG's gullwing doors. Ten to fifteen milliseconds after a detected rollover, explosive bolts situated at the top of the door frame fire and bell cranks separate the doors from the car for easy exit during a serious accident. An anti-lock braking system and a 3-stage electronic stability program (ESP) are standard equipment.
Exterior
The exterior aluminum body is supplied by Magna Steyr. The SLS and the CL65 AMG 40th Anniversary Edition are the only roadgoing Mercedes-Benz automobiles with the AMG Alubeam Silver exterior paint available, at an extra cost of €11,900 in Germany. Other colours include both metallic and matte colours, such as Designo Magno Kashmir, the matte paint known from the SL63 AMG IWC edition.
The SLS AMG has a retractable rear wing which extends at a speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) for stability and handling and acts as an airbrake when braking.
Models
The first model introduced in the SLS lineage was the coupé with gullwing doors. In mid-2010, an FIA-GT3 racing version was introduced; and for 2011–2013, Mercedes introduced a roadster version (with conventional doors and a soft top), an electric E-Cell version (coupé), and the ultimate iteration named the Black Series, which has a reduced weight of 70 kg (154 lb).

SLS AMG Black Series (2013)
Unveiled at the 2012 LA Auto Show, with a market launch that began in June 2013. the SLS AMG Black Series is a high-performance variant of the SLS AMG Coupé inspired by the SLS AMG GT3. Notable changes over the SLS AMG include increased engine power to 631 PS (464 kW; 622 hp) at 7,400 rpm and decreased torque to 635 N⋅m (468 lb⋅ft) at 5,500 rpm along with  increased engine redline of 8,000 rpm, fully revised high-speed valvetrain with modified camshafts, adapted cam geometry and optimised bucket tappets having a special coating which is otherwise exclusive to racing cars, modification of the intake air ducts (derestriction and adaptation to the new maximum engine speed), adaptation of the engine application and increase in peak pressure. This results in an acceleration time from 0–97 km/h (60 mph) in 3.2 seconds (Car and Driver test) (2/10 of a second faster than the SLS AMG GT), and a top speed of 196 mph (315 km/h). The Black Series engine was, at the time, the most powerful naturally aspirated V8 engine fitted into production cars, until the debut of the Chevrolet Corvette C8 Z06.
The Black Series is 70 kg (154 lb) lighter than the standard model. This is accomplished by increased use of carbon fibre in body panels, mechanical components, and the space frame. Further, a switch from steel to titanium for the exhaust system reduces weight by 13 kg (29 lb). The use of lithium-ion battery reduces weight by 8 kg (18 lb).
The AMG SpeedShift DCT 7-speed sports transmission is installed 10 mm (0.39 in) lower in order to achieve a lower centre of gravity for the car and is braced against the body by gas-filled struts in order to avoid stress cycles. The transmission's "Sport plus" and "Manual" modes have faster shifting speed than the standard model. The downshifting throttle blips are more audible. The new temporary "M" mode enables the driver to activate manual mode without having to remove a hand from the steering wheel, by pressing the "up" or "down" shift paddle once.

The visual motif is supported by a brief, meaningful message, such as "Oh Lord …" or "A cockpit. An engine. Two wings. Is it still a car?", for example. The print ad appeared in daily newspapers and magazines. A TV advert with Michael Schumacher telling the story of an experiment with the SLS AMG demonstrating its technical highlights from preparation and test phases to the realisation was produced. The TV ad was premiered on 30 January 2010 on all major television channels with a 60-second roadblock, followed by a 45-second version in reruns until the end of March. The Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG website was extended with the addition of an interactive guided tour of the AMG development plant. In addition, three editions of an online magazine provided extensive information on the performance ("Milliseconds"), the lightweight construction ("Milligrams") and the design ("Millimetres") of the SLS AMG. A reporter blog www.sls-amg-reporter.de was launched featuring fictional enthusiast Matthew K. posting reports, pictures and video clips of his travels as an SLS AMG reporter as he follows the global launch of the new gullwing. Starting at February 2010, a new iPhone application called "SLS AMG" was launched, featuring a preview of the car via 360° gameplay using the iPhone's accelerometer. SLS AMG also appeared in Gran Turismo 5, scheduled for release in 2010.

Successor
The SLS AMG was followed in 2014 by the substantially less expensive, and less powerful, Mercedes-AMG GT. Designed to compete against the Porsche 911, it relies on forced induction for its power and is available as a 462 PS (340 kW; 456 hp) GT and 510 PS (375 kW; 503 hp) GT S. AMG/Mercedes does not plan to replace the SLS any time soon, with AMG head Tobias Moers being quoted as follows in 2015: "Moers was adamant in reiterating that a true replacement for the modern Gullwing is not yet on the radar.  'Honestly, there's no [Mk II SLS] program running. Our homework for the next years is so much, so we took the decision to not replace directly the SLS because SLS has to stand by its own and the Gullwing is an iconic car.[...] If it takes 50 to 60 years to have a Gullwing replacement coming out of the 1950s then we can wait a few more years' [to replace the SLS Gullwing]."  Moers was also quoted as follows: "Speaking to Autocar at the (2015) Geneva Motor Show, Mercedes-AMG boss Tobias Moers confirmed that the company has no plans to create a new supercar to replace the SLS.  According to Moers, Mercedes is 'not in that league' at this moment in time."
As summed up by Moers, the "SLS AMG has won numerous awards of international significance.  Not least on the basis of its breathtaking design and acknowledged superb driving dynamics, the super sports car from Mercedes-AMG is today already determined to be a classic of the future," and particularly the "spectacular gullwing model," with these cars made more special by virtue of their also being "the first vehicle to be completely built by Mercedes-AMG."
In popular culture
The SLS AMG was developed with the assistance of David Coulthard.  In his review for Top Gear, Jeremy Clarkson praised the SLS AMG highly, saying it is "the greatest car in the world," noting that "it's more powerful than a Ferrari 458, louder than a Lamborghini, and it's way more fun than the 911RS GT Turbo 3S or whatever this week's ultimate Beetle (i.e., Porsche) is called. This is the thinking man's supercar."
The car was also used as the disguise for Soundwave in Transformers: Dark of the Moon.
