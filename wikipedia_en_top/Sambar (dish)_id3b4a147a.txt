Sambar (dish)
Sambar  (Tamil: [saːmbaːɾ] (listen), romanized: Sāmbār) is a lentil-based vegetable stew, cooked with pigeon pea and tamarind broth. It is popular in South Indian, Sri Lankan and Maldivian cuisines. The stew has been adapted into Burmese cuisine as a popular accompaniment to Burmese curries.


History
The story goes that the original recipe for sambar a dish which is so intrinsic to Tamil Nadu cuisine can actually be traced to Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji's son Sambhaji. Legend has it that Shivaji's son Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje Bhonsale, who was one of the Maratha rulers, attempted to make dal for himself when his head chef was away.
He loved his own concoction which was then referred to as 'Sambar'.



According to food historian K. T. Achaya, the earliest extant mention of sambar in literature can be dated to the 17th century in Tamilakam.
The word sambar (சாம்பார்) stems from the Tamil word champāram (சம்பாரம்).
A Tamil inscription of 1530 CE, shows the use of the word champāram in the sense of meaning a dish of rice accompanying other rice dishes or spice ingredients with which a dish of vegetable rice is cooked:
