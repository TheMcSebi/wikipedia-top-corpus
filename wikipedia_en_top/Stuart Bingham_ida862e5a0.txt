Stuart Bingham
Stuart Bingham (born 21 May 1976) is an English professional snooker player who is a former world and Masters champion. Bingham won the 1996 World Amateur Championship but enjoyed little sustained success in the early part of his professional career. His form improved in his mid-thirties: at age 35, he won his first ranking title at the 2011 Australian Goldfields Open, which helped him enter the top 16 in the rankings for the first time.


At 38, Bingham won the 2015 World Championship, defeating Shaun Murphy 18–15 in the final. The oldest first-time world champion in snooker history, he was the second player, after Ken Doherty, to have won world titles at both amateur and professional levels. His world title took him to a career-high number two in the world rankings, a spot he held until March 2017. He won his second Triple Crown title at the 2020 Masters, defeating Ali Carter 10–8 in the final. Aged 43 years and 243 days, he superseded Ray Reardon as the oldest Masters' champion. In 2017, Bingham received a six month competition ban for breaching rules concerning betting on matches involving himself and other players.
A prolific break-builder, Bingham has compiled over 500 century breaks during his career. He has scored nine career maximum breaks, the fourth most of any player, behind only Ronnie O'Sullivan (15), John Higgins (12), and Stephen Hendry (11).

Personal life
Bingham married Michelle Shabi in 2013 in a ceremony held in Cyprus. He moved the date of his wedding and cancelled his bachelor's party to make sure he could play in snooker competitions. The couple have a son, Shae, born in 2011; a daughter, Marnie Rose, born in January 2017; and Michelle's daughter Tegan, born in 2003. Bingham was once a keen amateur golfer, but made the decision to play less golf so that he could focus on snooker.
Bingham is nicknamed "ball run", given to him during his amateur career as he was perceived to have more luck than other players.
