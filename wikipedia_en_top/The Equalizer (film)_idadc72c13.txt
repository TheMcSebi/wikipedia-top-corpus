Plot
Former Marine and DIA operative Robert McCall lives a quiet, routine life in Boston, working at a Home Mart hardware store. He helps his coworker Ralphie train to become a security guard, and often spends late nights reading at a diner where he befriends Alina, a teenage prostitute trafficked by the Russian mafia. When Alina is badly beaten by her pimp, Slavi, Robert visits her in the hospital and questions her friend, Mandy. He goes to Slavi's restaurant and offers to buy Alina's freedom, but Slavi refuses, leading Robert to expertly kill him and his men in a matter of seconds. 
Slavi's boss, powerful kingpin Vladimir Pushkin, sends his enforcer Teddy Rensen to find and eliminate the culprit. Assisted reluctantly by Frank Masters, a police detective on Pushkin's payroll, Rensen finds Mandy and forces her to tell him about Robert before killing her. He also finds security footage of Robert entering the restaurant. 
Meanwhile, Robert continues to take the law into his own hands, intimidating a pair of corrupt cops and retrieving a ring for Jenny, a coworker who was robbed at gunpoint. Rensen tracks down Robert at his apartment, unsuccessfully posing as a police officer. He later tries to abduct him, but Robert escapes and leaves a fake paper trail for Rensen and Masters, watching on hidden cameras as they search his apartment. 
Robert's old friend and DIA colleague Susan Plummer informs him that Slavi's crew was the East Coast hub of Pushkin's criminal operations, and "Teddy Rensen" is Nicolai Itchenko, a Spetsnaz-trained former member of the Russian secret police. Robert tortures Masters for information with exhaust from his own car and forces him to help shut down one of Pushkin's money-laundering warehouses. He also sends Masters' flash drive, loaded with information about Pushkin's  activities, to the FBI. 
He confronts Nicolai, revealing that he knows about the latter's troubled history. Pledging to bring down Pushkin's empire, Robert destroys two of his oil tankers. In response, Nicolai and his men go to the Home Mart, taking Ralphie and other employees hostage. Robert kills the henchmen one by one with improvised weapons and traps, rescues his coworkers, and kills Nicolai with a nail gun. 
Three days later, Robert confronts Pushkin at his Moscow mansion, killing his guards and tricking him into electrocuting himself. Returning home, Robert is thanked by Alina, who has started a new life with money he anonymously left her. Inspired to continue using his skills to help people in need, Robert posts an online advertisement as The Equalizer.
