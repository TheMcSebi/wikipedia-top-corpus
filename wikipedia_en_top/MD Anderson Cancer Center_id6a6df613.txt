MD Anderson Cancer Center
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (colloquially MD Anderson Cancer Center) is a comprehensive cancer center in Houston, Texas.  It is the largest cancer center in the U.S. and one of the original three comprehensive cancer centers in the country. It is both a degree-granting academic institution and a cancer treatment and research center located at the Texas Medical Center in Houston. It is affiliated with The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. According to Newsweek, MD Anderson Cancer Center is considered the best hospital in the world for oncology and related cancer treatment.
History
The cancer center is named after Monroe Dunaway Anderson, a banker and cotton trader from Jackson, Tennessee. He was a member of a business partnership with his brother-in-law Will Clayton. Their company became the largest cotton company in the world. Anderson feared that in the event of one of the partners' deaths, the company would lose a large amount of money to estate tax and be forced to dissolve. To avoid this, Anderson created the MD Anderson Foundation with an initial sum of $300,000. In 1939 after Anderson's death, the foundation received $19 million.
In 1941 the Texas Legislature had appropriated $500,000 to build a cancer hospital and research center. The Anderson Foundation agreed to match funds with the state if the hospital were located in Houston in the Texas Medical Center (another project of the Anderson Foundation) and named after Anderson.
Using surplus World War II Army barracks, the hospital operated for 10 years from a converted residence and 46 beds leased in a Houston hospital before moving to its current location in 1954.
The institution became the subject of controversy in 2005 when it leased the use of its name to private investors who intended to promote a particular therapeutic approach, proton therapy.  An article in the Houston Chronicle suggested that the arrangement between the center and the investors might skew incentives, providing M.D. Anderson with non-medical reasons to "send as many patients as possible into the program."
Organization
Status
Being part of The University of Texas System, MD Anderson Cancer Center is managed under a nonprofit structure; however, for-profit agreements have caused some to question the motives of the center.
MD Anderson enjoys university status by providing fellowship, internship and residency opportunities to Ph.D.s and medical professionals. The institution offers master's degrees, Ph.D.s and dual M.D./Ph.D. degrees to students enrolled in The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center UTHealth Houston Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences formerly The University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston (UT-GSBS), which it operates with UT Health Science Center at Houston. Areas of study include: Biochemistry & Cell Biology, Cancer Biology, Genetics & Epigenetics, Immunology, Medical Physics, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases, Neuroscience, Quantitative Sciences, and Therapeutics & Pharmacology. Additionally, the institution offers bachelor's and master's degrees to students enrolled in The UT MD Anderson Cancer Center School of Health Professions. Areas of study include clinical laboratory science, cytogenetic technology, cytotechnology, diagnostic imaging, diagnostic medical sonography, healthcare disparities, diversity and advocacy, histotechnology, medical dosimetry, molecular genetic technology, diagnostic genetics, radiological sciences and radiation therapy.
Recognition
In addition to its No. 1 ranking in cancer care by U.S. News & World Report, the cancer center ranks first in the number of National Cancer Institute grants and invested more than $862.8 million in research in FY 2018. The cancer center also has received Magnet Nursing recognition from the American Nurses Credentialing Center.
In May 1996, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) established the Collaborating Center for Supportive Cancer Care at the Pain Research Group, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. The terms of reference engage the Anderson Center in the development of palliative care programs throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.
Presidents
MD Anderson has had five full-time presidents in its history:
Mendelsohn stepped down from his position on Sept. 1, 2011, when Ronald A. DePinho, M.D., became president. Mendelsohn remained on the faculty as co-director of the new Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Institute for Personalized Cancer Therapy. Mendelsohn died on January 7, 2019, from glioblastoma.
Growth
United States growth
The cancer center continues to grow, increasing in size by 50% in the past 10 years. Presently, the Houston complex now includes more than 680 inpatient beds, several research buildings and outpatient clinic buildings, two faculty office buildings, and a patient-family hotel in addition to other off-site facilities for clinical and research use.
Recently completed construction projects include two new research buildings on MD Anderson's South Campus and the addition of nine floors that can accommodate more than 300 new inpatient beds in Alkek Hospital on the North Campus.
MD Anderson's first facility on its Mid Campus opened in 2011 and includes a 25-story building to support current office space and future growth needs.
Also in 2011, the Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Foundation gave $150 million to MD Anderson. The new Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Building for Personalized Cancer Care is an international center of clinical excellence focusing on using the latest advances in genetic information to develop safe, more effective treatments for patients on a case-by-case basis.
In 2012 the Houston Main Building (originally the Prudential Building) was demolished, with plans to redevelop the site. The building had originally been purchased by MD Anderson in 1974 for $18.5 million.
