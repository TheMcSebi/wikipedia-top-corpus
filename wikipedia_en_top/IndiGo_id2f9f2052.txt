Fleet developments
IndiGo placed an order for 100 Airbus A320-200 aircraft worth US$6 billion in June 2005 during the Paris Air Show with plans to commence operations in mid-2006. The airline received its first A320 in July 2006 and planned to induct 100 aircraft by 2015–2016. IndiGo signed a memorandum of understanding for an additional 180 Airbus A320 aircraft including 150 with the New Engine Option (NEO) worth US$15 billion on 11 January 2011. In 2012, the airline took delivery of its 50th aircraft and the 100th aircraft was delivered on 4 November 2014, completing its initial order ahead of schedule.
The Airbus A320neo family aircraft ordered in 2011 were to be delivered starting 2015. However, due to a delay in the production and delivery of these aircraft, IndiGo dry-leased a total of 22 used aircraft to cope with the demand. On 15 October 2014, IndiGo expressed its intention to order a further 250 A320neo aircraft worth US$25.7 billion at list prices. On 15 August 2015, IndiGo confirmed the order for 250 A320neo aircraft for $26.5 billion. The order also provides IndiGo the flexibility to convert some A320neos to A321neoLRs that can seat more passengers and fly on longer routes. The order for 250 jets was Airbus' single largest order by number of aircraft. IndiGo received the first A320neo in March 2016. On 10 October 2019, Airbus delivered its 1000th A320neo aircraft to Indigo.
