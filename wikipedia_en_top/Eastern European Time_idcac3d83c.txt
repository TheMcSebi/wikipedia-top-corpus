Eastern European Time
Eastern European Time (EET) is one of the names of UTC+02:00 time zone, 2 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time. The zone uses daylight saving time, so that it uses UTC+03:00 during the summer.
A number of African countries use UTC+02:00 all year long, where it is called Central Africa Time (CAT), although Egypt and Libya also use the term Eastern European Time.
The most populous city in the Eastern European Time zone is Cairo, with the most populous EET city in Europe being Athens.

Anomalies
Since political, in addition to purely geographical, criteria are used in the drawing of time zones, it follows that time zones do not precisely adhere to meridian lines. The EET (UTC+02:00) time zone, were it drawn by purely geographical terms, would consist of exactly the area between meridians 22째30' E and 37째30' E. As a result, there are European locales that despite lying in an area with a "physical" UTC+02:00 time, are in another time zone; likewise, there are European areas that have gone for UTC+02:00, even though their "physical" time zone is different from that. Following is a list of such anomalies:
Areas west of 22째30' E ("physical" UTC+01:00) that use UTC+02:00
Areas east of 37째30' E ("physical" UTC+03:00) that use UTC+02:00
Areas that use UTC+01:00
These areas have sunrises and sunsets at least half an hour earlier than places on the UTC+01:00 meridian.
Areas that use UTC+03:00
Tripoints and borders between zones
Major metropolitan areas
