Pennsylvania House of Representatives
The Pennsylvania House of Representatives is the lower house of the bicameral Pennsylvania General Assembly, the legislature of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. There are 203 members, elected for two-year terms from single member districts.
It is the largest full-time state legislature in the country. The New Hampshire House of Representatives is larger but only serves part-time.
Qualifications
Representatives must be at least 21 years of age. They must be a U.S. citizen and a PA resident four years, and a resident of that district one year prior to their election and must reside in that district during their term. 
Hall of the House
The Hall of the House contains important symbols of Pennsylvania history and the work of legislators.
Speaker of the House
The speakership is the oldest elected statewide office in the Commonwealth.  Since its first session in 1682—presided over by William Penn—over 130 house members have been elevated to the speaker's chair. The house cannot hold an official session in the absence of the speaker or their designated speaker pro tempore.  Speaker Leroy Irvis was the first African American elected speaker of any state legislature in the United States since Reconstruction. Speaker Dennis O'Brien was the only minority-party Speaker known in Pennsylvania and only the second known nationwide. Pennsylvania has never had a female speaker.
Democrat Mark Rozzi was elected Speaker of the House in a bipartisan vote on January 3, 2022, and declared he would caucus with neither party in the closely divided chamber, becoming Pennsylvania's first independent speaker.
