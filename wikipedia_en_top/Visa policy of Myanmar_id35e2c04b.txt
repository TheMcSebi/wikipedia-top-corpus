They would have to pay a fee of US$50 to obtain the visa.
eVisa
Myanmar launched an eVisa system on 1 September 2014. eVisas are issued online for tourism and business purposes only. An evisa is issued within 3 working days, is valid for 90 days from the date of issue and allows a maximum stay of up to 28 days (for tourists) or 70 days (for business travellers with an invitation). The fee for a business eVisa is US$70, while a tourist eVisa costs US$50. Visas are issued free of charge to children under 7.
The list of eligible countries was expanded twice, first in October 2014, then in January 2015. In July 2015, the business eVisa was introduced.
Holders of eVisas must enter from one of the following ports of entry:
Nationals of the following countries are eligible:
Note:

Myanmar Airways claims that nationals of all countries and jurisdictions may obtain a tourist visa on arrival valid for 28 days provided they are arriving at Yangon International Airport on a specific flight on Myanmar Airways International from Guangzhou, though this seems to conflict with the Myanmar Visa on Arrival requirements.
In August 2017 an expansion of the visa on arrival system was announced. In October 2018 an expansion of the visa-free system was announced for early 2019.
