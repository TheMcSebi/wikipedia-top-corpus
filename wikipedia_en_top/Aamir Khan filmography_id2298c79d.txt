Also in 2001, he starred alongside Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna in the acclaimed coming-of-age drama Dil Chahta Hai. Lagaan and Dil Chahta Hai are cited in the media as defining films of Hindi cinema. After a four-year hiatus, Khan portrayed the eponymous lead in Mangal Pandey: The Rising (2005), a period film that underperformed at the box office, after which he played leading roles in two top-grossing films of 2006—Fanaa and Rang De Basanti.
Khan made his directorial debut with Taare Zameen Par in 2007, a drama on dyslexia starring Darsheel Safary, in which Khan also played a supporting role. The film proved to be a critical and commercial success, winning him the National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare. Khan played a man with anterograde amnesia in the 2008 thriller Ghajini, after which he portrayed an engineering student in the comedy-drama 3 Idiots (2009), and a reclusive artist in the drama Dhobi Ghat (2010), which he also produced. Further success came when he played the antagonist of the adventure film Dhoom 3 (2013) and starred as the titular alien in the ₹7.4 billion (US$93 million)-grossing satire PK (2014). In 2016, Khan played the father of two young female wrestlers in the sports biopic Dangal, which earned over ₹20 billion (US$250 million) worldwide.
