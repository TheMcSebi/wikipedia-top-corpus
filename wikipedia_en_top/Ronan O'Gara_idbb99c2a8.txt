Retirement
After weeks of speculation following Munster's semi-final defeat to ASM Clermont Auvergne in the 2012–13 Heineken Cup, O'Gara's retirement was confirmed on 18 May 2013.
O'Gara explained his decision to retire: "I have ambitions in the years ahead to coach at a high level and, with this in mind, I can confirm now that I will be joining Racing Métro's coaching staff in July. I am trusting my instinct and it is telling me now is the appropriate time to stop (playing). Had I already decided to retire before the (Heineken Cup semi-final) loss in Montpellier last month? I kind of knew. My lads are gone. My boys in the team are gone." Munster Rugby Chief Executive Garrett Fitzgerald also paid tribute to O'Gara: "In wishing Ronan the very best in the future, I’d like to acknowledge the immense contribution he has made to Munster Rugby and indeed rugby in general in Ireland over the course of what has been a fabulous career."
Coaching career
O'Gara had been offered a one-year contract extension by Munster, but instead decided to take a coaching role with French club Racing 92. Starting in July 2013, O'Gara worked primarily as a defence coach with Racing. In 2016 he agreed a contract extension with Racing 92 until 2019. Amongst others, O'Gara coached former Ireland teammate Johnny Sexton, who expressed his delight at being able to work alongside his former Ireland rival. In June 2017, O'Gara joined the Ireland squad for their one-off test match against the United States as a skills coach.
In November 2017, Racing 92 agreed to release O'Gara early from his contract, so he could join the Crusaders coaching team in New Zealand. He began as assistant backs coach with the Crusaders on 1 January 2018, and extended his contract for the 2019 Super Rugby season in June 2018. O'Gara experienced success in his first season in Christchurch, with the Crusaders winning an 9th Super Rugby title, and they defended the title in the 2019 Super Rugby season, securing a record 10th title with a 19–3 win against Argentinian side Jaguares in O'Gara's final match as part of the Crusaders coaching staff.
O'Gara joined French Top 14 club La Rochelle to replace Xavier Garbajosa as their new head coach upon the conclusion of his duties with the Crusaders 2019 Super Rugby season, in time for the 2019–20 Top 14 season. Jono Gibbes, former Leinster forwards coach and Ulster head coach, was director of rugby at the club at the time.
Following La Rochelle's 27–16 away win against Gloucester in the last 16 of the 2020–21 Challenge Cup on 2 April 2021, O'Gara was interviewed post-match by BT Sport and explained how his rugby philosophy had developed whilst coaching in France and New Zealand, describing how KBA - Keep Ball Alive - had become intrinsic to his style of play and mindset as a coach. The interview was widely shared and praised by the rugby media. La Rochelle have also been praised for their astute game management and effective defence during O'Gara's tenure at the club.
O'Gara signed a new three-year contract with La Rochelle in April 2021, which will see O'Gara remain with the French club until the end of the 2023–24 season. With the news that director of rugby Jono Gibbes had joined rival club Clermont as their new head coach, O'Gara will oversee the full spectrum of rugby operations at La Rochelle, whilst also continuing his head coach responsibilities.
O'Gara faced an LNR disciplinary hearing in November 2021 after he failed to properly register his position on La Rochelle's teamsheet for their fixture against Toulon, which meant O'Gara was not allowed to be present pitch-side during the game, leading to a disagreement, albeit polite, between O'Gara and the fourth official.
Having lost to rivals Toulouse in the 2020–21 European Rugby Champions Cup final, O'Gara coached La Rochelle to their first major silverware when they defeated Leinster 24–21 in the 2021–22 Champions Cup final on 28 May 2022.
O'Gara was banned for six weeks for disrespecting a match official after La Rochelle's fixture against Lyon in September 2022, and he faced another LNR disciplinary hearing in November 2022 after being cited for alleged comments made towards a match official; O'Gara was subsequently banned for ten weeks and fined €20,000, €5,000 of which was suspended.
O'Gara reunited with his former Crusaders boss Scott Robertson to coach the Barbarians in their fixture against an All Blacks XV on 13 November 2022, which the Barbarians won 35–31. La Rochelle confirmed in December 2022 that O'Gara had extended his contract with the club until 2027; this followed weeks of speculation that O'Gara was being considered for the England head coach position.
Honours and achievements
Upon his retirement from playing, O'Gara held a number of honours and achievements at both club and international level. At the time, he had played for Ireland more times than any other player in history and had won nine trophies with Munster.
