Marketing
Realme's popularity can be attributed to its utilization of community-driven resources such as Facebook Community. In 2018, Realme Philippines created the Squad Leader Program.
According to Realme Philippines, the initial three Squad Leaders will help provide information to co-community members and manage the official Facebook Communities in exchange for Realme Perks (products and merchandises). 
From less than 5,000 members at the end of 2018, the Squad Leader Program were able to grow the company's official Facebook Community to over 500,000 combined Community members. This makes it one of the largest official Facebook Community of any smartphone brand in the country. 
Currently, the Squad Leader Program has over 7 members, all of them works for free.
