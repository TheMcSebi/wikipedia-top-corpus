Premise
In season one, set in 1958 New York City, Miriam "Midge" Maisel is a young, Jewish-American housewife and mother, living on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Each week, Midge's husband, Joel, performs at The Gaslight Café. Midge considers it a shared hobby, unaware the untalented Joel wants to be a professional comic. After a particularly dismal performance, a dejected Joel leaves Midge for his secretary. Midge, upset and drunk, returns to the Gaslight in her nightgown and stumbles onstage. In a bawdy impromptu set, Midge vents her predicament to the audience, then is arrested for obscenity. In the police car, Midge meets comic Lenny Bruce, also arrested for using obscenity. Gaslight manager Susie Meyerson bails Midge out of jail, and Midge later bails out Lenny. Recognizing Midge's raw talent, Susie coaches her to be a stand-up comic.
In the second season, Midge hones her comic skills at the Gaslight. As Susie works to book paying gigs, Midge hides her new career from family. Susie and Midge hit the road for a short comedy tour. Touring is harder than expected and female comics are discriminated against by their male counterparts. Midge later runs afoul of Sophie Lennon, a famous Great Depression-era female comedian who performs as an uncouth housewife from Queens. Midge rejects Sophie's advice to develop a similar gimmicky persona to compete in the male-dominated field. When Midge ridicules Sophie's corny act during a Gaslight set, a vindictive Sophie has her blacklisted from most clubs. Midge gets a big break when famous singer Shy Baldwin hires her for his upcoming tour.
In the third season, Midge's career is on an upswing touring with Shy Baldwin. Balancing her comedy career and family life is difficult, however. Although Midge and Joel are divorcing, they remain in each other's lives, even as both navigate new romantic relationships. Midge is furious when Susie agrees to manage the eccentric and unpredictable Sophie Lennon, then realizes Susie needs multiple clients to financially survive. Joel forges a different path into the entertainment industry by opening a nightclub in Chinatown, later discovering his landlords run a gambling den downstairs. After carelessly alluding to Shy's homosexuality during her set at the Apollo Theater, Midge is fired from the Baldwin tour.
The fourth season finds Midge enraged and humiliated after being fired. She struggles to restart her career and vows to only do headliner gigs, not opening acts. Complicating matters, a Daily News reporter continually disparages Midge's performances in print. Meanwhile, a jealous Sophie Lennon again thwarts Midge's career. Joel's landlords are unhappy that his successful club draws attention to their illegal activities. Joel also copes with girlfriend Mei's unexpected pregnancy, his mother's meddling, and his father's heart attack. Midge becomes the comic emcee at a strip club, seemingly content to languish there until police raid the place. Lenny Bruce gets Midge out in time, then helps reboot her career.

Development
In developing the series, Amy Sherman-Palladino was inspired by childhood memories of her father, a standup comedian based in NYC, and an admiration for early female comics such as Joan Rivers and Totie Fields.
In June 2016, Amazon gave the production a pilot order. The pilot episode was written by Sherman-Palladino, who was also executive producer. It premiered as a part of Amazon's Spring 2017 pilot season on March 17, 2017.

On February 17, 2022, Amazon renewed the series for a fifth and final season.

Filming
Principal photography for the pilot took place from September 27 to October 14, 2016, in Manhattan. Filming for the fourth season began on January 20, 2021 and wrapped in early July 2021. Filming for the fifth season began in late February 2022 in New York City.
Locations
Exterior shots for the Gaslight Club were filmed in October 2016 outside 96 St. Mark's Place in the Lower East Side, the building featured on the cover of Led Zeppelin's 1975 album Physical Graffiti. The building's residents were reportedly unhappy about the disruption that the production would cause.
Other New York locations included The Village Vanguard jazz club on Seventh Avenue South, a vintage record store on West 4th Street, and butcher's shop on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy which was also used as a location for the 1990 film The Godfather Part III. Exterior scenes set at the B. Altman department store were filmed at the B. Altman and Company Building at Fifth Avenue, while interiors were shot in a disused bank in Brooklyn.
Season 2's scenes set at the holiday resort in the Catskills were filmed on location at a holiday resort on the Oquaga Lake near Deposit. Paris scenes were filmed at various real-life locations in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris, and at the Musée Rodin at Hôtel Biron. One of the hotels in season 3 was the Fontainebleau Miami Beach.
Oners
The show makes frequent use of "oners," extended single-shot scenes. "Going to the Catskills" offers a two-minute oner depicting Midge and her family getting rambunctiously resettled in their summer home in the Catskills. It included a half-dozen overlapping vignettes. In "Strike Up the Band," in a 12-page scene, Midge comes into their apartment to find her parents fighting, with her clothes scattered everywhere. In another, Midge and Susie ride in an open Jeep to an airplane hangar where Midge will later open for Shy. The camera follows them from the Jeep into the hangar, where soldiers manhandle her onto the stage, which she crosses while waving to the nearly 1,000 soldiers facing her before she is lifted back into the Jeep.
Design
The "apartment" where Midge and her husband Joel live was created on the same set as the apartment where Midge's parents live, but with more modern (late-1950s) design, inspired in part by Doris Day movies, according to production designer Bill Groom. The "retro" typeface used for the show's logo is Sparkly by Stuart Sandler of Font Diner. The show's distinctive designs and costumes—most notably the women's hats and dresses—led the Paley Center for Media to create an exhibit called "Making Maisel Marvelous" in 2019.
In December 2019, two costumes from the series were acquired by the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution.
Release
Marketing
On October 10, 2017, the official trailer for the first season was released. On August 9, 2018, a teaser trailer for the second season was released. On October 24, 2018, the official trailer for season two was released. From December 1–8, 2018, Amazon opened up a pop-up restaurant in Manhattan's Nolita neighborhood modeled after Carnegie Deli as it appeared during the 1950s. The restaurant served a menu much more limited than what was actually offered at the original deli with the only two sandwich options being "The Maisel" and "The Susie." Other items offered included mini knishes, black and white cookies, cheesecake, and pickles. As the restaurant was purely for promotional purposes, nothing on the menu cost more than 99 cents, and all the proceeds went to support the Lower Eastside Girls Club.
In August 2019, to promote the show for the upcoming 71st Primetime Emmy Awards, Amazon partnered with various businesses in and around Santa Monica, California, to provide goods and services at 1959 prices. The offer to sell gasoline at $0.30 per gallon led to long queues and traffic jams in front of the gas station that offered the promotion, forcing police to intervene.
Premiere
The series held its official premiere on November 13, 2017, at the Village East Cinema in New York City.
Season 4's release format changes from the all-at-once binge of previous seasons to weekly releases of two episodes each.

Club praised the "outstanding" production design and said "this is a series that's as confident as its heroine—and what a heroine she is."
