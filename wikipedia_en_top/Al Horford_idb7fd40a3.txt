Al Horford
Alfred Joel Horford Reynoso (born June 3, 1986) is a Dominican professional basketball player for the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed "The Sexiest player in the NBA", Horford is a five-time NBA All-Star and is the highest paid Latin American basketball player.
He played college basketball for the Florida Gators and was the starting center on their back-to-back National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) national championships teams in 2006 and 2007. He was drafted with the third overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the Atlanta Hawks, a team he played nine seasons with before signing with the Celtics as a free agent in the 2016 off-season. After playing three seasons with the Celtics, he signed with the 76ers in the 2019 off-season and played a season with the team before being traded in the 2020 off-season to the Thunder. Prior to the 2021 season, Horford was traded to the Celtics, with whom he reached the NBA finals.
Early years and high school career
Horford was born in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. His father, Tito Horford, played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for three years and several more in other countries. In 2000, Horford and his family moved to Lansing, Michigan, where he attended Grand Ledge High School in Grand Ledge, Michigan, and was a star on its basketball team. Horford holds seven school records, including most career points (1,239). As a senior, he was named "Class A Player of the Year" after averaging 21 points, 13 rebounds and five blocks per game. While at Grand Ledge, Horford played AAU basketball for the Michigan Mustangs, who were runners-up in the Adidas Big Time National Tournament. Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Horford was listed as the No. 7 power forward and the No. 36 player in the nation in 2004. Horford is a member of the Church of God Ministry of Jesus Christ International.
College career
Horford accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida, choosing the Gators over Michigan, Michigan State, and Ohio State. There he played for coach Billy Donovan and teamed up alongside Joakim Noah, Corey Brewer and Taurean Green. He made an immediate impact for the Gators in 2004–05, starting at center in the front court with David Lee, and helped the Gators win the 2005 Southeastern Conference tournament championship.
The Gators surged through the 2005–06 season, winning the SEC championship for a second straight year. They entered the 2006 NCAA tournament as the No. 3 seed. The Gators swept through the first four rounds to reach the Final Four. There they defeated George Mason to reach the final. In the final, they defeated UCLA for the 2006 championship behind Horford's 14 points and seven rebounds.
In December 2006, midway through his junior year, Horford missed a series of games due to injury. Coach Donovan held him out of a game against Stetson in hopes that he would be adequately healed for a game in Gainesville against the third-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes on December 23. One day before the game, Donovan announced that Horford would be unable to play, but Horford entered the game from the bench to guard Ohio State player Greg Oden, a highly-touted 7'0" freshman. Oden scored just seven points, well below his season average of 15. Horford scored 11 points and added 11 rebounds in limited action, as the Gators defeated the Buckeyes. In the final home game of the season, on March 4, 2007, against Kentucky, Horford became the fourth player on his team to score 1,000 career points. He required 14 points during the game to reach the milestone, and scored exactly 14.
On April 2, 2007, the Gators became the first team to repeat as national champions since the 1991–92 Duke Blue Devils, and the first ever to do so with the same starting lineup. They defeated Oden and Ohio State in a rematch from the regular season, 84-75. Three days later, Horford, Joakim Noah, Corey Brewer and Taurean Green all declared for the NBA draft.

During the 2011 NBA All-Star Weekend, Horford was an All-Star for the second straight year, and he was also a member of the Atlanta team that won the Shooting Stars Competition.

Injury-shortened season (2011–2012)
Due to the 2011 NBA lockout, the 2011–12 season did not begin until December 25, 2011. Horford appeared in the Hawks' first 11 games of the season before missing the final 55 due to a torn left pectoral muscle, an injury suffered on January 11, 2012, against the Indiana Pacers. On January 17, he underwent surgery to repair the muscle and was ruled out for three-to-four months. With a 40–26 record, the Hawks entered the playoffs as the fifth seed in the East. Horford missed an additional three playoff games before returning to action in Game 4 of the Hawks' first round series against the Boston Celtics. He played out the series, a series the Hawks lost 4–2.
Career-best season (2012–2013)

Another injury-shortened season (2013–2014)
Over the first 29 games of the 2013–14 season, Horford posted nine double-doubles and scored in double-figures 28 times, including 13 20-point outings and one 30-point game. Over this stretch, he averaged a career-best 18.6 points per game. However, another shoulder injury suffered on December 26, 2013, sidelined him for the rest of the season. Initially considered a "bruised right shoulder", the injury turned out to be a complete tear of his right pectoral muscle, and required season-ending surgery. He did not play in the postseason, where the Hawks lost in the first round to the Indiana Pacers.
Return to All-Star form (2014–2016)
In 2014–15, Horford played in 76 regular season games, the most since the 2010–11 season. On December 22, 2014, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, December 15 through Sunday, December 21. He earned the award for just the second time in his career.

Behind Horford and fellow All-Star teammates Paul Millsap, Kyle Korver and Jeff Teague, the Hawks finished the regular season with the best record in the East at 60–22, and advanced through to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since the 1960s, when the franchise was located in St. Louis.
