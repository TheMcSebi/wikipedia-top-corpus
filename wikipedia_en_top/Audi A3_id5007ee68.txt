Audi A3
The Audi A3 is a subcompact executive/small family car (C-segment) manufactured and marketed by the German automaker Audi AG since September 1996,  currently in its fourth generation.
The first two generations of the Audi A3 were based on the Volkswagen Group A platform, while the third-generation and fourth-generation A3 uses the Volkswagen Group MQB platform.
First generation (Typ 8L; 1996)
The original A3 (or Type 8L) was announced back in June 1995, but introduced first in the European market for more than year in September 1996, marking Audi's return to the production of smaller cars following the demise of the Audi 50 in 1978. This was the first Volkswagen Group model to use the "PQ34" or "A4" platform, bearing a close resemblance to the contemporary Volkswagen Golf Mk4, which arrived a year later. Within three years, this platform was used for total of seven cars.
The A3 was initially available only with a three-door hatchback body, to present a more sporty image than the Golf, in both front and four-wheel drive. The inline four-cylinder engines were transversely mounted. The Audi A3 was the eighth model in the Audi lineup to use five valves per cylinder. The dashboard was also used by the first generation SEAT León and second generation SEAT Toledo.
The United Kingdom market first received the Audi A3 in November 1996.
In 1999 Audi expanded the range with the introduction of more powerful versions: a 1.8 turbo rated 180 PS (132 kW; 178 hp), and a 1.9 TDI diesel engine with unit injector "Pumpe Düse" (PD) technology and variable geometry turbocharger. The four-wheel-drive A3 1.8T quattro used either the 150 PS (110 kW; 148 hp) or 180 PS (132 kW; 178 hp) engine, and the same Haldex Traction-based four-wheel-drive system as the Audi S3 and the Audi TT. Also in 1999, Audi also introduced a five-door body.
In late 2000 the A3 range was revised with new headlights and rear lamps, other minor cosmetic changes, an improved interior, and the introduction of a six-speed manual gearbox, on the 180 PS (132 kW; 178 hp) 1.8 Turbo and the new 130 PS (96 kW; 128 hp) 1.9 TDI.
Audi's electronic stability control, traction-control, and brake force distribution computer became standard equipment in some countries.
Although the first-generation Audi A3 was replaced in Europe in 2003, the first generation model continued to be sold in some markets. Production of the first generation model stopped in Brazil in 2006.
Safety
Euro NCAP rating of 4 out of 5 stars. Their evaluation concluded "the column lock, adjuster lever and bracket presented hazards in the knee impact area for the driver. These could cause high loads on his upper legs and damage to his knees." The A3 also provides almost no protection to pedestrians, giving it two stars out of a possible four.
S3 (1999–2003)
Audi released the A3-derived Audi S3 in 1999, only as a three-door hatchback. The inline-four 20v 1.8 L turbocharged petrol engine came in two versions: 210 PS (154 kW; 207 hp) and 225 PS (165 kW; 222 hp). Early models (1999–2001) had 210 PS (154 kW; 207 hp). Later models (2001–2003) had variable valve timing and 225 PS (165 kW; 222 hp). The engine had a maximum of 280 N⋅m (210 ft⋅lbf) torque. This was the first time a small four-cylinder engine had been used in an Audi S-series car.
Although dubbed "quattro", the S3 uses a different four-wheel drive system. The Haldex Traction coupling adjusts the bias of torque distribution from the front to rear axle as grip requirements change – most of the time it operates as a front-wheel drive.
The S3 was sold in Europe, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.
The S3 was given a facelift in 2002, where it was given one-piece headlights/indicator units, different front wings, rear lights clusters, and some minor upgrades to interior trim.
Standard features include xenon HID headlamps with high pressure washers and auto levelers, front fog lamps, 17" "Avus" alloy wheels with 225/45R17 tyres, electrically adjustable Recaro leather seats, climate control, alarm and electronic stability control with traction control.
Options include a Bose sound system, boot/trunk or in-dash mounted 6-disc CD changer, metallic paint, 18-inch 9-spoke RSTT wheels, glass sunroof, centre arm rest, privacy glass (B-pillar backwards), auto-dimming rear-view mirror, parking assist, luggage net, heated front seats, cruise control, aluminium door mirror casings and part leather/Alcantara (blue/silver/yellow) combination seat coverings. These items are standard in some export markets.
Engines
The engines used are the same as those for many other cars in the Volkswagen Group.
Second generation (Typ 8P; 2003)
Initial release
At the 2003 Geneva Motor Show, Audi launched the second generation of the A3, the Typ 8P, designed by Gary Telaak during 2000 (however, the final design was frozen in 2001). Originally launched only as a three-door hatchback with four-cylinder engines, it featured a new automobile platform (the PQ35 platform), a redesigned and more spacious interior, new petrol engines with Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), and standard six-speed manual gearboxes (except on the base 1.6 petrol and 1.9 diesel).
In mid-2003 the line was updated with two sports-oriented models, a 2.0 Turbo-FSI version rated 200 PS (147 kW; 197 hp), and a 3.2 L VR6 engine (for the first time) with 250 PS (184 kW; 247 hp). Haldex Traction-based quattro on-demand four-wheel drive, and the S-Tronic semi-auto gearbox were introduced as options (quattro is standard on the VR6) on models with engines over 140 PS (103 kW; 138 hp).
In 2005 the "S line" trim level, offering new decorative elements, became available and the three-door A3 received the same front-end styling features as the Sportback model. For the first time, the A3 became available in the North American market, exclusively with the Sportback body, with the base 2.0 inline-four FSI introduced in 2005 as a 2006 model, and the 3.2 VR6 Quattro following.
A3 Sportback (2004–2013)
The five-door "Sportback" model was introduced in June 2004. The A3 Sportback is 80 mm (3.1 in) longer than the base three-door body, and includes improved rear cabin space and a larger luggage compartment (370 litres). It also received the new "single frame" front grille originally introduced in the A8 W12, which was later adopted across the whole A3 range.
S3 (2006–2013)
In August 2006, Audi introduced the second generation S3. Offered in three- and five-door body styles, the second generation—Typ 8P—S3 is powered by a modified and uprated Volkswagen Group-sourced 2.0-litre turbocharged FSI petrol engine, with a maximum output of 195 kW (265 PS; 261 bhp). As with all Audi S models, the design was done in-house by quattro GmbH. The engine features uprated high-performance pistons, revised boost/fuel mapping, increased turbocharger size (KKK K04) and larger intercooler. The most powerful form of this engine, and quattro four-wheel drive, makes for a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) time of 5.5 seconds, and an electronically limited top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph). Audi offers both six-speed manual and six-speed S-Tronic automatic transmissions with the S3.
The spring ratings and dampers were revised, along with the body kit. Like its predecessor, although badged a "Quattro" model, the S3 does not employ a Torsen centre differential (as in other common Quattro models), but instead uses the Swedish Haldex Traction system in its on-demand four-wheel drive transmission, due to the transverse engine layout.
Safety

Euro NCAP tested a second-generation Audi A3 with front airbags, side airbags, seatbelt pretensioners, and load limiters as standard. Despite Audi increasing the protection inside the car for the driver and passengers, pedestrian safety actually got 33% worse compared to the first generation and Euro NCAP gave criticism for the car offering virtually no protection at all on the front end and scoring just one star from a possible four. "A poor result for a new car" was the verdict given for pedestrian safety after the test.
2008 facelift
Audi introduced a number of changes to the A3 and S3 in 2008. These include revised nose and tail styling, with a modified grille and daytime running lights, common rail 2.0 TDI engines, seven-speed S tronic dual clutch transmission availability for the smaller non-U.S. engines, and optional "magnetic ride" adaptive shock absorbers. In addition, the range now includes an S3 Sportback model.
Also, a cabriolet version was introduced. It was similar in dimensions to the 3-door version, with a two-box design.
Audi A3 TDI Clubsport quattro (2008)
Audi A3 TDI Clubsport quattro is a concept car unveiled in 2008. Based on the Audi A3 three-door, it is an approach by Audi to address both performance and the environment.
The engine in the concept car is a turbocharged 2.0-litre diesel producing 224 hp (167 kW) and 332 lb⋅ft (450 N⋅m). of torque. It produces 113.8 horsepower (84.9 kW) per litre while meeting Euro 5 Diesel emission standards. It uses the quattro drive system with a six-speed manual transmission.
The chassis has Audi's Magnetic Ride Suspension system, lowering the vehicle 1.4 inches (36 mm) from the base model. It also has ceramic front brakes, a four-link rear suspension and electro-mechanical servo assist for the rack and pinion steering.
Exterior modifications include the widening of the three-door's grill, modifying the odd, and enlarging air intakes. Bolt-on fender flares and a large rear spoiler have been added. The interior changes include sport seats and a flat-bottomed steering wheel.
Audi claims performance of 0 to 62 mph (0 to 100 km/h) in 6.6 seconds with a top speed of 149 mph (240 km/h). It is expected to get approximately 40 miles per US gallon (5.9 L/100 km; 48 mpg‑imp).

The synthetic methane was produced by waste product from a nearby Werlte biogas plant operated by power utility EWE.
A3 Sportback e-tron (2014–2018, 2020)
The plug-in hybrid concept car was unveiled at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show. In May 2013 Audi confirmed its decision to produce a plug-in hybrid version of the A3, the Audi A3 Sportback e-tron, which was scheduled for retail sales in Europe by late 2013, and by mid 2014 in the U.S. and the UK. The A3 e-tron shares the same plug-in hybrid powertrain used in both the Volkswagen Golf GTE and Passat GTE. To charge the A3 e-tron, the Audi four rings logo is pulled along to reveal a charging socket.
The A3 Sportback e-tron is powered by a 1.4 L TSI gasoline engine that delivers 148 bhp (110 kW) and 184 lb⋅ft (249 N⋅m) of torque, coupled with a 101 bhp (75 kW) electric motor, which is integrated into the car's six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, for a total combined output of 201 bhp (150 kW) and 243 lb⋅ft (329 N⋅m) The plug-in hybrid has an 8.8 kWh battery pack that delivers an all-electric range of 50 km (31 mi) on the NEDC cycle, and a total of 940 km (584 mi). The plug-in hybrid can reach a top speed of 220 km/h (137 mph) and can accelerate from 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 7.6 seconds. According to Audi the car has an average fuel efficiency of 188 mpg equivalent and CO2 emissions of 35 g/km.
After some delays, the A3 Sportback e-Tron went on sale across Europe in August 2014. The first 227 units were registered in Germany in August 2014. As of December 2015, global sales totaled 12,994 units, of which, 12,945 units were registered in Europe, and 49 units in the United States, where deliveries began in December 2015.
Audi discontinued the A3 PHEV Sportback e-tron in Europe in November 2018. However, the model was briefly re-introduced at the end of 2019 for MY20, now called A3 Sportback 40 e-tron under Audi's new naming scheme. The revised A3 e-tron in the UK featured a different level of specification, losing the previously standard LED headlights but gaining Audi's virtual cockpit as standard. The revised model featured the same battery and drivetrain as before, now rated at 22 miles of electric range under the new WLTP test.

It went on sale in the first quarter of 2015 and featured a 2.5 litres (2,480 cc) straight-5 engine with 367 PS (270 kW; 362 hp) and 465 N⋅m (343 lbf⋅ft) of torque. The RS 3 Sportback is equipped with 7-speed dual clutch S tronic transmission and quattro all-wheel drive system. Scott Keogh of Audi of America said in April 2015 that he's "confident" we'll see the car come to the United States.
In 2017, the RS3 sedan or saloon was added to the line-up. The RS3 can be ordered with a fixed-suspension or an adjustable magnetic damper. Depending on the country, the RS3 can be purchased with different optional packages. For example, the Black Optic package includes high-gloss black 19-inch wheels, high-gloss black outside mirror covers, and a high-gloss black trunk lip spoiler, while the Dynamic package consists of titanium 19-inch wheels with summer performance tires, red brake calipers, and a sport exhaust system.
2016 facelift
After four years, the third-generation Audi A3 was given a facelift for the model year 2016, which also coincided with the 20th anniversary of the A3 name. The facelifted model was first unveiled through a set of official images in April 2016. The new A3 sedan was given significant cosmetic updates, which were inline with the automaker's new design philosophy. As a result, the 2017 Audi A3 featured the Matrix LED headlamps that were earlier seen in the A8 flagship sedan and the R8 supercar. The front grille was also given a refreshed treatment that made the A3 look like the A4. Changes on the sides and rear were minimal, with only the taillights getting optional LEDs. There were multiple updates on the interior as well, with a fully digital 12.3-inch instrument cluster screen placed behind a revised steering wheel available as an optional upgrade. Sold in Europe and released in the United States for the 2016 model year.

Fourth generation (Typ 8Y; 2020)
The new A3 was unveiled online in 2020.
The new interior and exterior styling is heavily inspired by Lamborghini, LED headlights and taillights, with the option of Matrix and Laser LED headlights. It shares the MQB evo platform with other Audi models, and with the Volkswagen Golf Mk8, SEAT Leon Mk4, and Škoda Octavia Mk4.
It is 3 centimetres longer and wider when compared to the outgoing model while keeping the wheelbase length the same, trunk cargo space is 380 litres with the seats up, and 1200 litres with the seats folded down. It has a drag coefficient of 0.28, and is powered by 1.0-liter 3-cylinder gasoline turbocharged engine with 110 hp, 1.5-litre  with 150 hp, 2.0-liter TDI with 116 hp or 150 hp.
There is also a new 2.0-liter Quattro version in both gasoline and diesel variants. It produces 190 hp (142 kW) and 320 N⋅m (236 lbf⋅ft) of torque (400 Nm for the diesel variant). It also has reduced cargo space (320 litres instead of the 380 litres in the other A3 variants) due to the Quattro four-wheel-drive system.
The S3 model has the same 2.0L petrol engine from the previous generation, producing 310 hp (231 kW) and 400 N⋅m (295 lbf⋅ft) of torque, but this time is only available with an automatic gearbox. Similarly it has reduced cargo space due to the Quattro four-wheel-drive system.
Like the previous generation, the new S3 also comes as a saloon/sedan.
The new A3 Sedan was revealed on 21 April 2020, with the front fascia similar to that of the A3 Sportback. Compared with its predecessor, the new A3 Sedan is 4 cm longer (4.50 meters), 2 cm wider (1.82 meters), and 1 cm taller (1.43 meters). However, the wheelbase remains unchanged.
This generation of the A3 sedan is not expected to arrive in North America until late 2021, as a 2022 model.
North America will not get the Sportback e-Tron like before. In the countries that will receive The PHEV A3 will no longer be called The e-tron because this name is reserved for electric Audi cars. Instead, it is called The TFSIe. There are 2 version of the TFSIe, called the "40" and the "45". The former dispatches a 0-60 mph (97 km/h) time of 7.8 sec, while the latter is based on the Golf GTE and is a second quicker to 60 mph (97 km/h).
This generation of the A3 sportback is arriving in Thailand this November 2021, as a 2022 model.
Audi RS 3
The highest specification RS 3 model is fitted with a 2.5-litre 5-cylinder producing 400 hp (298 kW) and 500 N⋅m (369 lbf⋅ft), and has 0-60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration time of just 3.8 seconds. It gets a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic, or an electric S-Tronic gearbox.
It also gets the new MMI infotainment system, with a 10.25 or 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, and a secondary screen of 10.1-inches.
