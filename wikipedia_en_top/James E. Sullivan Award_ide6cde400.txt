James E. Sullivan Award
The AAU James E. Sullivan Award, presented by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), is awarded annually in April to "the most outstanding amateur athlete in the United States".  Representatives from the AAU created the AAU Sullivan Award with the intent to recognize amateur contributions and achievements from non-professional athletes across the country, though the award has recognized contributions from professional athletes such as Caeleb Dressel as well.
The award was established in 1930 in honor of the organization's founder and past president, James Edward Sullivan. Based on the qualities of leadership, character, sportsmanship, and the ideals of amateurism, the AAU Sullivan Award "goes far beyond athletic accomplishments and honors those who have shown strong moral character".  Finalists are selected from public nominations following a review by the AAU Sullivan Award Executive Committee.  Approximately 10 semi-finalists are chosen, and the eventual winner is determined by votes from various members of the nationwide news media, former winners and AAU personnel. More recently, a portion of the winner's vote has been determined by the general public.  Recipients are eligible for subsequent awards, although this has yet to happen.
The inaugural winner of the award was golfer Bobby Jones, winner of 13 majors between 1923 and 1930.  The first female recipient, in 1944, was swimmer Ann Curtis, who won more national AAU championships than any other woman.
