History
1984–1996: ModiLuft era
The origins of SpiceJet can be tracked back to March 1984 when the company was established by Indian industrialist S. K. Modi to provide private air taxi services. On 17 February 1993, the company was named as MG Express and entered into technical partnership with the German flag carrier Lufthansa. The airline provided passenger and cargo services under the name of Modiluft before ceasing operations in 1996.
2005–2013: inception and expansion
In 2004, the company was acquired by Ajay Singh and the airline planned to restart operations as SpiceJet following the low-cost model. SpiceJet leased two Boeing 737-800 aircraft in 2005 and planned to order 10 new aircraft for expansion. SpiceJet opened bookings on 18 May 2005 and the first flight was operated between Delhi and Mumbai on 24 May 2005. By July 2008, it was India's third-largest low-cost carrier in terms of market share after Air Deccan and IndiGo. Indian media baron Kalanidhi Maran acquired 37.7% stake in SpiceJet in June 2010 through Sun Group. The airline ordered 30 Boeing 737-8 aircraft worth US$2.7 billion July 2010 and a further 15 Bombardier Q4 Dash short-haul aircraft worth US$446 million in December 2010.
In 2012, SpiceJet suffered a loss of over ₹39 crore (US$4.9 million) owing to increase in global crude prices. On 9 January 2012, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, reported that several airlines in India, including SpiceJet, have not maintained crucial data for the flight operations quality assurance. The Bombay Stock Exchange announced that ever since June 2011, SpiceJet had been suffering losses. In 2012, Kalanidhi Maran increased his stake in the airline by investing ₹100 crore (US$13 million) in the airline. The airline returned to profits at the end of the same year.  SpiceJet entered into an inter airline pact with Tigerair on 16 December 2013 which was scrapped in January 2015.

In January 2015, the Sun Group sold its entire shareholding and transferred control to Ajay Singh.
In late September 2017, the airline announced that it had placed a firm order for 25 Q400 turboprop aircraft.
In 2019, following the grounding of Jet Airways, Spicejet took over nearly 30 aircraft that were grounded by the former.
2020–present: pandemic
SpiceExpress—the logistics arm of SpiceJet airline—has helped to keep the company afloat during the pandemic amid drastic drop in passenger business. In May 2021, the airline earned ₹200 crore from freight operations and commands a 5 per cent market share in India's outbound cargo business.
In July 2021, SpiceJet reported net losses shrunk to US$34.6 million during the fiscal quarter ended 31 March 2021, as revenue fell by 28% annually to $294.8 million. The airline plans to raise funds to the tune of $337.2 million to ensure its long term sustainability.
In May 2022, Directorate General of Civil Aviation started a safety investigation into SpiceJet's aircraft following a series of incidents involving malfunctioning plane equipment, including an incident where a flight from Mumbai to Durgapur experienced severe turbulence that injured 12 passengers and 3 crew members.
In July 2022, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation has imposed restrictions on SpiceJet flights following reports of continuous technical glitches. For eight weeks, the DGCA has directed that only 50% of the existing flight services should be allowed to fly. The proposal also states that there will be strict monitoring by DGCA during this period.
