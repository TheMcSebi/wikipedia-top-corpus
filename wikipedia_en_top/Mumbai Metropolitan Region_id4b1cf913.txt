Mumbai Metropolitan Region
Mumbai Metropolitan Region (abbreviated to MMR and previously also as Greater Bombay Metropolitan Area), is a metropolitan area  consisting of Mumbai (Bombay) and its satellite towns in the northern Konkan division, of the Maharashtra state in western India. The region has an area of 6,355 square kilometres (2,454 sq mi) and with a population of over 26 million it is among the most populous metropolitan areas in the world.
Developing over a period of about 20 years, it consists of nine municipal corporations and eight smaller municipal councils. The entire area is overseen by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), a state-owned organisation in charge of town planning, development, transportation and housing in the region.
The MMRDA was formed to address the challenges in planning and development of integrated infrastructure for the metropolitan region. The areas outside Brihanmumbai (Greater Mumbai) and Navi Mumbai have lacked organised development. Navi Mumbai, developed as one of the largest planned cities in the world, was promoted by a state government-owned company, City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO).
The region has had problems related to haphazard and illegal development as a result of rapid urbanisation. Villages along the NH 3 in Bhiwandi are examples of haphazard developments in the MMR, with some of the largest warehousing areas in India. Government agencies such as the Town Planner and Collector of Thane have had challenges in addressing unorganised development.
