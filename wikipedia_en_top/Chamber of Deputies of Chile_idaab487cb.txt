Electoral system
Since 2017, Chile's congress has been elected through open list proportional representation under the D'Hondt method.
Before 2017, a unique binomial system was used. These system rewards coalition slates. Each coalition could run two candidates for each electoral district's two Chamber seats. Typically, the two largest coalitions in a district divided the seats, one each, among themselves. Only if the leading coalition ticket out-polls the second-place coalition by a margin of more than two-to-one did the winning coalition gain both seats.
with seats allocated using the simple quotient.
