The governance of North East Lincolnshire Council has come under scrutiny from the audit commission on two occasions leading to special public interest reports for its failings. During this time (between 2003 and 2011) it was run politically as a coalition between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. In June 2011 it became a minority Labour controlled Council. In 2012, Labour gained a majority on the authority, before losing it two years later and have run it as a minority. In 2019, the Conservatives managed to gain a majority for the first time since the establishment of the council in 1996.

Transport
There are four main roads that link to the unitary authority - the A180 (from the M180) which was built in 1984, and the A46 from Lincoln. The A46 terminates in Cleethorpes, previously terminating at the Laceby roundabout, and follows the former route of the A18 through Grimsby and Cleethorpes. The A18 which runs from Doncaster  to Laceby past the Humberside  Airport. And the A16  from southern Lincolnshire  through Louth, Entering the town at toll bar roundabout Waltham
There are good connections by railway from Doncaster and Sheffield, which start at Manchester Airport - the TransPennine Express.
It is transport by sea that the area has national significance. The two ports of Immingham and Grimsby, when combined, have the largest tonnage of freight of any UK port. Immingham has many DFDS freight routes (DFDS Seaways since 2010, the former DFDS Tor Line) to Europe.
Education
The local LEA has comprehensive schools, becoming comprehensive in the early 1970s when part of the County Borough of Grimsby, and the Lindsey Education Committee, based in Lincoln. However, due to the proximity of West and East Lindsey which have grammar schools, some children capable of passing the eleven-plus are bussed over the border to places such as Caistor, Louth, and Alford. Previous to this Cleethorpes had girls' and boys' grammar schools, and Grimsby had the girls' and boys' (which joined in the late 1960s) Wintringham grammar schools.
The local secondary schools have improved in recent years, but Grimsby still has some of the worst GCSE results in the country. There is a clear cut dichotomy of education up to 16, with schools on the edge of Grimsby and Cleethorpes performing with respectable results, leaving the centre of these towns with struggling schools that have faced closure. Most schools have converted to Academy status, with some also lucky enough to move into brand new spacious buildings. It is more the case that affluent parents would refuse to send their children to schools in central Grimsby, hence the schools on the outer edge do much better.
Franklin College has a good reputation at A level, and regularly produces the best A level results for state schools in the former area of Humberside (north and south). It was formed by the Humberside Education Committee, based in Beverly. Sixth formers travelled from East and West Lindsey to attend this college, such was its reputation.
The main FE college in Grimsby is the Grimsby Institute. This offers a wide range of vocational courses and has links with the fishing industry. It offers higher education courses, and has done for many years - HNDs, for vocational subjects. It has the long-term ambition to become a university. The University of Humberside used to have its food science campus at the college, but removed this when it became the University of Lincoln.
