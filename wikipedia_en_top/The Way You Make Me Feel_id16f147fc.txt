Background and composition
"The Way You Make Me Feel" was recorded by Michael Jackson in 1987 for his seventh studio album Bad, which was released the same year it was recorded. Epic Records released the song as the third single from the album in November that year. "The Way You Make Me Feel" was written and co-produced by Jackson, and produced by Quincy Jones. Before the recording of Bad, Jackson had written more than sixty songs for the album, with plans of releasing a three-disc album, but after Jones convinced Jackson to make Bad a one-disc LP, "The Way You Make Me Feel" and ten other songs were selected for the album. According to Bad 25, the song and subsequent video was intended to show another aspect to public's perception of Michael Jackson in addition to his reputation as a lover ("I Just Can't Stop Loving You") and being streetwise ("Bad") they wanted to show him as a flirt or able to pick up girls.
"The Way You Make Me Feel" has been featured on multiple greatest hits and compilation albums by Jackson since the song's release, including the first disc of Jackson's two-disc compilation album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I in 1995, Jackson's greatest hits album Number Ones in 2003, and the This Is It compilation album in 2009.
Musically, "The Way You Make Me Feel" is a pop and R&B song composed of blues harmonies. Jackson's vocal range on the recording spans from B3 to A5. The song is played in the key of E major.
Critical reception

AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine listed the song alongside the album's title track, "I Just Can't Stop Loving You", and "Man in the Mirror" as being "track picks" from Bad.

Greg Quill, writing for the Toronto Star, commented that "the notion of individual as opposed to institutionalized self-improvement", a recurring theme for the singer, was present "to a lesser extent in the love songs 'The Way You Make Me Feel' and 'Liberian Girl', which deal more with surrender than conquest or self-gratification." The Washington Post's Rickard Harrington commented that on songs like "The Way You Make Me Feel", Jackson "sings the way he dances". Cash Box called it a "brilliantly crafted upbeat pop number" with "memorable lyrics" and "a playful musical backdrop."

Music video
The music video for "The Way You Make Me Feel" was directed by Joe Pytka and was filmed in June 1987 at Skid Row, Los Angeles. It was choreographed by Jackson and Vincent Paterson. The short version of the video is six minutes and forty-four seconds long and the full version is nine minutes and thirty-three seconds long. The video begins with a group of men trying to pick up women, but failing. One of the men, Jackson, is told to go home and not to hang around with the other guys anymore. When Jackson walks home, an elderly man (played by Joe Seneca), who is sitting on the steps of his house, tells him to just be himself. Jackson notices a woman, played by model/dancer Tatiana Thumbtzen, walking down the streets alone.
Shortly after Jackson walks out of an alley and stands in front of Thumbtzen while she is walking down the street. However, she ignores him and keeps walking, which prompts the other guys to make fun of him. Jackson shouts at them, which gets the attention of everyone, including Thumbtzen. After walking up to her, Jackson begins singing "The Way You Make Me Feel" to her while also dancing. Uninterested, Thumbtzen walks away. He follows her, having been cheered on by his friends to "pursue" her. Another dance routine begins, involving the man's friends, which leads to the man 'pursuing' the woman throughout the neighborhood. The video ends with the man eventually "winning the woman over", and embracing her, while a fire hydrant sprays out water. The videoclip features an appearance by his sister La Toya as one of Thumbtzen's friends.
The music video was released on October 31, 1987, and received one nomination at the 1988 MTV Video Music Awards Ceremony. The video, alongside Jackson's "Bad" video, was nominated for Best Choreography, but lost to Jackson's younger sister Janet's video "The Pleasure Principle".
The music video was included on the video albums: Video Greatest Hits â€“ HIStory (long version on DVD and short version on VHS), Number Ones (short version), Michael Jackson's Vision (long version) and the Target version DVD of Bad 25 (long version).
The introduction of the full version of the video also samples the Roy Ayers 1985 song "Hot" (written by Binky Brice, Philip Hunter Field and James Mtume) from his You Might Be Surprised album.
