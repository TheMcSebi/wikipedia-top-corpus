Early life
Lima was born on 12 June 1981 in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. Many sources stated that "Francesca" is her middle name, but Lima herself denied this in an interview to W Radio Colombia in 2010, and confirmed that her name is only Adriana Lima.

Lima never thought about being a model, although she had won many beauty pageants in elementary school.

Due to her success rate with the company, the European and Russian branch of Mavi decided to make her the global face of the brand.
