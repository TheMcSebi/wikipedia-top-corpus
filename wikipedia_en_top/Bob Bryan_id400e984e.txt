Bob Bryan
Robert Charles Bryan (born April 29, 1978) is an American former doubles world No. 1 tennis player. He has won twenty-three Grand Slam titles: 16 in men's doubles and 7 in mixed doubles. He turned professional in 1998. With his twin brother Mike, he was the world No. 1 doubles player for several years, first achieving the top ranking in September 2003. The brothers were named ATP Team of the Decade for 2000–2009. The brothers became the second men's doubles team to complete the Career Golden Slam at the 2012 Summer Olympics.
Bob Bryan ended his 2018 season early with subsequent hip surgery in August 2018 due to an injury he sustained during his Madrid final retirement earlier in May 2018, which would have elevated the Bryan brothers as the oldest players back to the top of the men's doubles ranking if they were victorious. His recovery from hip surgery took around 5 months, which led his brother Mike to partner with compatriots Sam Querrey and then more successfully with Jack Sock during Bob's absence.
Bob and Mike Bryan retired in August 2020. In their final two tournaments, the Bryan brothers successfully defended their title in Delray Beach, also winning the decisive rubber in a U.S. Davis Cup tie in Honolulu.
Tennis career
Doubles records
Junior
He finished the year as the no. 1 ranked singles player in the nation in 1998 after winning the clay court nationals and reaching the finals of Kalamazoo. The brothers were back-to-back Kalamazoo doubles champions in 1995 and 1996 and won the US Open Junior doubles title in 1996.
College
He played for Stanford University in 1997 and 1998, where he helped the Cardinal win back-to-back NCAA team championships. In 1998, he won the "Triple Crown" by taking the NCAA singles, doubles (with his twin brother Mike), and team titles. He was the first man to accomplish this since Stanford's Alex O'Brien did it in 1992.
ATP Tour
With his twin brother Mike (who is the older by two minutes), Bob has won 116 doubles titles, including sixteen Grand Slam titles. In 2005, the Bryan brothers made it to the finals of all four Grand Slam tournaments, only the second time a men's doubles team has done this during the open era. In 2006, the Bryan brothers won Wimbledon and the Australian Open and completed a Career Grand Slam. Having won the 2012 US Open, they followed up by winning the first three majors of 2013, and thus held all four titles at once.  They could not complete the calendar year Grand Slam, however, as they lost in the semi-finals of the 2013 US Open.
The twins have been the year-ending top-ranked team ten times: in 2003 2005, 2006 and 2007,  and then each year from 2009 to 2014 inclusive.
The Bryan brothers have been frequent participants on U.S. Davis Cup teams. The United States sealed its 32nd title at the 2007 Davis Cup.
In the 2018 Madrid Masters 1000 final, Bob injured his hip, and the pair had to retire down 3–5 in the first set. He underwent a hip relining and made a remarkable recovery, rejoining his brother less than a year later for the 2019 Australian Open and making it to the quarterfinals. They won their first title since his surgery in February 2019 at Delray Beach.
World TeamTennis
Both brothers kicked off their World TeamTennis careers back in 1999 for the Idaho Sneakers. They went on to play for the Newport Beach Breakers in 2004, the Kansas City Explorers from 2005 to 2012, the Texas Wild in 2013, the San Diego Aviators in 2014, the California Dream in 2015, the Washington Kastles from 2016 to 2018, and most recently the Vegas Rollers in 2019. They have two World TeamTennis titles, one from the Newport Beach Breakers in 2004, and another from the Kansas City Explorers in 2010. It was announced that Bob, along with twin brother Mike, will be joining the Vegas Rollers during the 2020 WTT season set to begin July 12 at The Greenbrier.
Off-court
The Bryans guest starred on 8 Simple Rules and were on the Jan/Feb 2010 cover of Making Music Magazine. Their father, Wayne Bryan, wrote a book about his sons, The Formula: Raising Your Child to be a Champion.

Bob Bryan married Florida attorney Michelle Alvarez in 2010; the couple have three children.
