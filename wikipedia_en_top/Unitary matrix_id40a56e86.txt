Unitary matrix
In linear algebra, an invertible complex square matrix U is unitary if its conjugate transpose U* is also its inverse, that is, if
where I is the identity matrix.
In physics, especially in quantum mechanics, the conjugate transpose is referred to as the Hermitian adjoint of a matrix and is denoted by a dagger (†), so the equation above is written
The real analogue of a unitary matrix is an orthogonal matrix. Unitary matrices have significant importance in quantum mechanics because they preserve norms, and thus, probability amplitudes.
Properties
For any unitary matrix U of finite size, the following hold:
For any nonnegative integer n, the set of all n × n unitary matrices with matrix multiplication forms a group, called the unitary group U(n).
Any square matrix with unit Euclidean norm is the average of two unitary matrices.
Equivalent conditions
If U is a square, complex matrix, then the following conditions are equivalent:
Elementary constructions
2 × 2 unitary matrix
The general expression of a 2 × 2 unitary matrix is
which depends on 4 real parameters (the phase of a, the phase of b, the relative magnitude between a and b, and the angle φ). The determinant of such a matrix is
The sub-group of those elements $MATH$ with $MATH$ is called the special unitary group SU(2).
The matrix U can also be written in this alternative form:
which, by introducing φ1 = ψ + Δ and φ2 = ψ − Δ, takes the following factorization:
This expression highlights the relation between 2 × 2 unitary matrices and 2 × 2 orthogonal matrices of angle θ.
Another factorization is
Many other factorizations of a unitary matrix in basic matrices are possible.
