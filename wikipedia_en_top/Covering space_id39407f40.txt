Covering space
A covering of a topological space $MATH$ is a continuous map $MATH$ with special properties.
Definition
Let $MATH$ be a topological space. A covering of $MATH$ is a continuous map
such that there exists a discrete space $MATH$ and for every $MATH$ an open neighborhood $MATH$, such that $MATH$ and $MATH$ is a homeomorphism for every $MATH$.
Often, the notion of a covering is used for the covering space $MATH$ as well as for the map $MATH$. The open sets $MATH$ are called sheets, which are uniquely determined up to a homeomorphism if $MATH$ is connected.: 56  For each $MATH$ the discrete subset $MATH$ is called the fiber of $MATH$. The degree of a covering is the cardinality of the space $MATH$. If $MATH$ is path-connected, then the covering $MATH$ is denoted as a path-connected covering.
Examples
Properties
Local homeomorphism
Since a covering $MATH$ maps each of the disjoint open sets of $MATH$ homeomorphically onto $MATH$ it is a local homeomorphism, i.e. $MATH$ is a continuous map and for every $MATH$ there exists an open neighborhood $MATH$ of $MATH$, such that $MATH$ is a homeomorphism.
It follows that the covering space $MATH$ and the base space $MATH$ locally share the same properties.
Factorisation
Let $MATH$ and $MATH$ be continuous maps, such that the diagram 
commutes.
Product of coverings
Let $MATH$ and $MATH$ be topological spaces and $MATH$ and $MATH$ be coverings, then $MATH$ with $MATH$ is a covering.: 339 
Equivalence of coverings
Let $MATH$ be a topological space and $MATH$ and $MATH$ be coverings. Both coverings are called equivalent, if there exists a homeomorphism $MATH$, such that the diagram
commutes. If such a homeomorphism exists, then one calls the covering spaces $MATH$ and $MATH$ isomorphic.
Lifting property
An important property of the covering is, that it satisfies the lifting property, i.e.:
Let $MATH$ be the unit interval and $MATH$ be a covering. Let $MATH$ be a continuous map and $MATH$ be a lift of $MATH$, i.e. a continuous map such that $MATH$. Then there is a uniquely determined, continuous map $MATH$, which is a lift of $MATH$, i.e. $MATH$.: 60 
If $MATH$ is a path-connected space, then for $MATH$ it follows that the map $MATH$ is a lift of a path in $MATH$ and for $MATH$ it is a lift of a homotopy of paths in $MATH$.
Because of that property one can show, that the fundamental group $MATH$ of the unit circle is an infinite cyclic group, which is generated by the homotopy classes of the loop $MATH$ with $MATH$.: 29 
Let $MATH$ be a path-connected space and $MATH$ be a connected covering. Let $MATH$ be any two points, which are connected by a path $MATH$, i.e. $MATH$ and $MATH$. Let $MATH$ be the unique lift of $MATH$, then the map 
is bijective.: 69 
If $MATH$ is a path-connected space and $MATH$ a connected covering, then the induced group homomorphism
is injective and the subgroup $MATH$ of $MATH$ consists of the homotopy classes of loops in $MATH$, whose lifts are loops in $MATH$.: 61 
Branched covering
Holomorphic maps between Riemann surfaces
Let $MATH$ and $MATH$ be Riemann surfaces, i.e. one dimensional complex manifolds, and let $MATH$ be a continuous map. $MATH$ is holomorphic in a point $MATH$, if for any charts $MATH$ of $MATH$ and $MATH$ of $MATH$, with $MATH$, the map $MATH$ is holomorphic.
If $MATH$ is holomorphic at all $MATH$, we say $MATH$ is holomorphic.
The map $MATH$ is called the local expression of $MATH$ in $MATH$.
If $MATH$ is a non-constant, holomorphic map between compact Riemann surfaces, then $MATH$ is surjective and an open map,: 11  i.e. for every open set $MATH$ the image $MATH$ is also open.
Ramification point and branch point
Let $MATH$ be a non-constant, holomorphic map between compact Riemann surfaces. For every $MATH$ there exist charts for $MATH$ and $MATH$ and there exists a uniquely determined $MATH$, such that the local expression $MATH$ of $MATH$ in $MATH$ is of the form $MATH$.: 10  The number $MATH$ is called the ramification index of $MATH$ in $MATH$ and the point $MATH$ is called a ramification point if $MATH$. If $MATH$ for an $MATH$, then $MATH$ is unramified. The image point $MATH$ of a ramification point is called a branch point.
Degree of a holomorphic map
Let $MATH$ be a non-constant, holomorphic map between compact Riemann surfaces. The degree $MATH$ of $MATH$ is the cardinality of the fiber of an unramified point $MATH$, i.e. $MATH$.
This number is well-defined, since for every $MATH$ the fiber $MATH$ is discrete: 20  and for any two unramified points $MATH$, it is: $MATH$
It can be calculated by: 
Definition
A continuous map $MATH$ is called a branched covering, if there exists a closed set with dense complement $MATH$, such that $MATH$ is a covering.
Examples
Universal covering
Definition
Let $MATH$ be a simply connected covering. If $MATH$ is another simply connected covering, then there exists a uniquely determined homeomorphism $MATH$ :{\tilde {X}}\rightarrow E}
  
, such that the diagram
commutes.: 482 
This means that $MATH$ is, up to equivalence, uniquely determined and because of that universal property denoted as the universal covering of the space $MATH$.
Existence
A universal covering does not always exist, but the following properties guarantee its existence:
Let $MATH$ be a connected, locally simply connected topological space; then, there exists a universal covering $MATH$.
$MATH$ is defined as $MATH$ :\gamma {\text{ is a path in }}X{\text{ with }}\gamma (0)=x_{0}\}/{\text{ homotopy with fixed ends}}}
  
 and $MATH$ by $MATH$.: 64 
The topology on $MATH$ is constructed as follows: Let $MATH$ be a path with $MATH$. Let $MATH$ be a simply connected neighborhood of the endpoint $MATH$, then for every $MATH$ the paths $MATH$ inside $MATH$ from $MATH$ to $MATH$ are uniquely determined up to homotopy. Now consider $MATH$, then $MATH$ with $MATH$ is a bijection and $MATH$ can be equipped with the final topology of $MATH$.
The fundamental group $MATH$ acts freely through $MATH$ on $MATH$ and $MATH$ :\Gamma \backslash {\tilde {X}}\rightarrow X}
  
 with $MATH$ is a homeomorphism, i.e. $MATH$.
Examples
Deck transformation
Definition
Let $MATH$ be a covering. A deck transformation is a homeomorphism $MATH$, such that the diagram of continuous maps
commutes. Together with the composition of maps, the set of deck transformation forms a group $MATH$, which is the same as $MATH$.
Examples
Properties
Let $MATH$ be a path-connected space and $MATH$ be a connected covering. Since a deck transformation $MATH$ is bijective, it permutes the elements of a fiber $MATH$ with $MATH$ and is uniquely determined by where it sends a single point. In particular, only the identity map fixes a point in the fiber.: 70  Because of this property every deck transformation defines a group action on $MATH$, i.e. let $MATH$ be an open neighborhood of a $MATH$ and $MATH$ an open neighborhood of an $MATH$, then $MATH$ is a group action.
Definition
A covering $MATH$ is called normal, if $MATH$. This means, that for every $MATH$ and any two $MATH$ there exists a deck transformation $MATH$, such that $MATH$.
Properties
Let $MATH$ be a path-connected space and $MATH$ be a connected covering. Let $MATH$ be a subgroup of $MATH$, then $MATH$ is a normal covering iff $MATH$ is a normal subgroup of $MATH$.
If $MATH$ is a normal covering and $MATH$, then $MATH$.
If $MATH$ is a path-connected covering and $MATH$, then $MATH$, whereby $MATH$ is the normaliser of $MATH$.: 71 
Let $MATH$ be a topological space. A group $MATH$ acts discontinuously on $MATH$, if every $MATH$ has an open neighborhood $MATH$  with $MATH$, such that for every $MATH$ with $MATH$ one has $MATH$.
If a group $MATH$ acts discontinuously on a topological space $MATH$, then the quotient map $MATH$ with $MATH$ is a normal covering.: 72  Hereby $MATH$ is the quotient space and $MATH$ is the orbit of the group action.  
Examples
Calculation
Let $MATH$ be a group, which acts discontinuously on a topological space $MATH$ and let $MATH$ be the normal covering. 
Examples
Galois correspondence
Let $MATH$ be a connected and locally simply connected space, then for every subgroup $MATH$ there exists a path-connected covering $MATH$ with $MATH$.: 66 
Let  $MATH$ and $MATH$ be two path-connected coverings, then they are equivalent iff the subgroups $MATH$ and $MATH$ are conjugate to each other.: 482 
Let $MATH$ be a connected and locally simply connected space, then, up to equivalence between coverings, there is a bijection:
$MATH$
For a sequence of subgroups $MATH$ one gets a sequence of coverings $MATH$. For a subgroup $MATH$ with index $MATH$, the covering $MATH$ has degree $MATH$.
Classification
Category of coverings
Let $MATH$ be a topological space. The objects of the category $MATH$ are the coverings $MATH$ of $MATH$ and the morphisms between two coverings $MATH$ and $MATH$ are continuous maps $MATH$, such that the diagram 
commutes.
G-Set
Let $MATH$ be a topological group. The category $MATH$ is the category of sets which are G-sets. The morphisms are G-maps $MATH$ between G-sets. They satisfy the condition $MATH$ for every $MATH$.
Equivalence
Let $MATH$ be a connected and locally simply connected space, $MATH$ and $MATH$ be the fundamental group of $MATH$. Since $MATH$ defines, by lifting of paths and evaluating at the endpoint of the lift, a group action on the fiber of a covering, the functor $MATH$ is an equivalence of categories.: 68â€“70 
Applications
An important practical application of covering spaces occurs in charts on SO(3), the rotation group. This group occurs widely in engineering, due to 3-dimensional rotations being heavily used in navigation, nautical engineering, and aerospace engineering, among many other uses. Topologically, SO(3) is the real projective space RP3, with fundamental group Z/2, and only (non-trivial) covering space the hypersphere S3, which is the group Spin(3), and represented by the unit quaternions. Thus quaternions are a preferred method for representing spatial rotations â€“ see quaternions and spatial rotation.
However, it is often desirable to represent rotations by a set of three numbers, known as Euler angles (in numerous variants), both because this is conceptually simpler for someone familiar with planar rotation, and because one can build a combination of three gimbals to produce rotations in three dimensions. Topologically this corresponds to a map from the 3-torus T3 of three angles to the real projective space RP3 of rotations, and the resulting map has imperfections due to this map being unable to be a covering map. Specifically, the failure of the map to be a local homeomorphism at certain points is referred to as gimbal lock, and is demonstrated in the animation at the right â€“ at some points (when the axes are coplanar) the rank of the map is 2, rather than 3, meaning that only 2 dimensions of rotations can be realized from that point by changing the angles. This causes problems in applications, and is formalized by the notion of a covering space.
