Lamborghini Huracán
The Lamborghini Huracán (Spanish for "hurricane"; [uɾaˈkan]) is a sports car manufactured by Italian automotive manufacturer Lamborghini replacing the previous V10 offering, the Gallardo. The Huracán was revealed online in December 2013, making its worldwide debut at the 2014 Geneva Auto Show, and was released in the market in the second quarter of 2014. The LP 610-4 designation comes from the car having a 610 metric horsepower and four-wheel drive, while LP stands for "Longitudinale Posteriore", which refers to the longitudinal mid-rear engine position.


Name
The Huracán's name (huracán being the Spanish word for hurricane) is inspired by a Spanish fighting bull. Names from historical Spanish fighting bulls has been the traditional naming scheme of most Lamborghini car models. Huracán was a bull known for its courage that fought in 1879.
Specifications and performance
Engine
The Huracán maintains the 5.2-litre naturally aspirated Audi/Lamborghini V10 engine with an additional 0.2 litres, compared to the Gallardo, tuned to generate a maximum power output of 449 kW (602 hp; 610 PS). To ensure its balance and performance, the car is mid-engined. The engine has both direct fuel injection and multi-point fuel injection. It combines the benefits of both of these systems; it is the first time this combination is used in a V10 engine. To increase its efficiency, the Huracán's engine also includes a start-stop system. The firing order of the engine is 1, 6, 5, 10, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 9. This is printed on a metal plate on the top of the engine, as with all other Lamborghini models.
The drag coefficient of Cd=0.39 was undisclosed until 2021.
Performance
With a curb weight of 1,553 kg (3,424 lb), the Huracán LP 610-4 has a power-to-weight ratio of 2.55 kg (5.62 lb) per horsepower.

Technical information
The Huracán has an electronically controlled all-wheel drive system, which aims to increase the traction on various surfaces and the overall performance of the car. The car has a 7-speed dual clutch transmission, Lamborghini's new 'Doppia Frizione' (Dual Clutch) gearbox.  The transmission performs differently depending on the mode the driver has selected. The different drive modes available are Sport, Strada and Corsa, Corsa being the highest performance mode. The Huracán will only be available with an automatic transmission; a manual will not be offered.
The Huracán also has a magnetically controlled suspension system. It utilises magnetorheological dampers to very quickly change how the suspension acts, ensuring performance as well as usability.
The Huracán has various components in common with the second generation of the Audi R8. This is due to the sharing of Volkswagen's sports car technology among both of the cars.
Interior
The Huracán has various interior options for upgraded comfort inside the car. It has a choice for full electric control and heating of the sport seats in addition to the standard lengthwise alignment and electric backrest.  The car also has an optional navigation system and leather upholstering. The Huracán is one of the first sports cars moving the infotainment system out of the center stack: Lamborghini Infotainment System. The result: a display that lets the driver decide what they want to see. It is the first Lamborghini automobile to use the 12.3 inch TFT virtual cockpit from parent company Audi, which is available with high-definition (1440 x 540) 3D computer graphics, Bluetooth, Google Earth GPS navigation and Multi Media Interface-like menu and dashboard controls, all powered by Nvidia Tegra 3.
Technology
Various aspects of the Huracán are technologically advanced. The car has full LED headlamps, which ensure higher contrast in night conditions. Also, the Huracán has optional "Lamborghini Dynamic Steering" (LDS) to add to the standard power steering. The Dynamic Steering changes the steering performance from normal, comfortable steering to a racing feeling. The main control for changing the car's performance according to driving conditions is the mode selector ANIMA (Adaptive Network Intelligent Management). ANIMA controls the engine, the transmission, LDS, the all-wheel drive, magnetorheological suspension, and the electronic stability control. The Lamborghini Piattaforma Inerziale (LPI) carries out precise measurements of the vehicle movements using on board sensors (3 accelerometers and 3 gyroscopes) linked to ANIMA via high-speed FlexRay CAN bus. The driver can select street, sport, or race mode to alter how systems like the engine or transmission respond while driving.

Huracán LP 580-2 (2016–2019)
Unveiled at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show, the Huracán LP 580-2 is a lower cost derivative of the Huracán LP 610-4 that differs mostly in having the 5.2 L V10 engine detuned to 427 kW (572 hp; 580 PS) and 533 N⋅m (393 lb⋅ft) of torque along with having a rear wheel drive drivetrain instead of the all-wheel drive drivetrain found in the standard Huracán. Lamborghini claims the car will accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 3.4 seconds and 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 10.1 seconds. The top speed is claimed to be as high as 320 km/h (199 mph). It also features slight visual differences to the standard variant of the car – with a different front fascia and larger air vents at the rear of the car for improved brake cooling. The seven-speed dual-clutch transmission is the same as used in the standard LP 610–4. The base level LP 580-2 costs US$201,100, about US$40,000 less than the base level LP 610–4.
Huracán LP 580-2 Spyder (2016–2019)
A convertible variant of the Huracán LP 580-2 was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show on 16 November 2016. The 5.2-litre naturally-aspirated V10 engine is the same as in the coupé, and generates a maximum power output of 427 kW (572 hp; 580 PS). 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) takes 3.6 seconds and the top speed is 320 km/h (199 mph).
Huracán LP 640-4 Performante (2017–2019)
A track oriented variant of the Huracán, called the Performante, was unveiled at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show.
The Performante underwent various exterior changes with the most noticeable being the front and rear bumpers. Carbon fibre is used for the bumpers and the side skirts. An adjustable carbon fibre rear wing has been added to increase downforce. The position of the exhaust has also been changed, and is now just a bit above the rear diffuser. The interior also underwent noticeable changes, now sporting new seats and a new digital speedometer (similar to that of the Aventador SV's speedometer).
The Performante's 5.2-litre V10 has been tuned to have a power output of 471 kW (631 hp; 640 PS) at 8,000 rpm and 601 N⋅m (443 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,500 rpm. The weight has also decreased by 40 kg (88 lb), courtesy of the forged aluminium and forged carbon fibre body components (first used in the construction of the Sesto Elemento). All the new aero components on the car have active aerodynamic capability and help keep the car stable at high speeds. The Performante is capable of accelerating from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.9 seconds, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 8.9 seconds. It also has a theoretical top speed of 325 km/h (200 mph).
The car has been stiffened by 10% with new springs, roll bars, and radial axial arm bushings. The magnetorheological suspension has been reworked to give a driver a serious track experience. The Lamborghini Dynamic Steering has been re-calibrated. The Performante utilises Lamborghini's new ALA (Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva) system, which is said to be 80% lighter than regular sports car hydraulic systems. According to Lamborghini, ALA is also said to provide 750% more downforce than the standard Huracán. The price of the car is set at US$274,390.
Huracán LP 640-4 Performante Spyder (2018–2019)
The Lamborghini Huracán Performante Spyder was unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show. It takes much of the styling inspiration from the coupé and the outgoing LP 610-4 Spyder. The Spyder is identical to the coupé from performance and technological standpoint, but the acceleration time from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) has risen by one-tenth of a second and stands at 3.1 seconds while the 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) has risen by four-tenths of a second and stands at 9.3 seconds. Due to the loss of the roof, the Spyder weighs 125 kg (276 lb) more than the coupé due to chassis reinforcing components. Top speed remains the same as well and stands at 325 km/h (202 mph). Deliveries of the Spyder began in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Facelift (2019-present)
Huracán Evo (2019–present)
The Huracán received a mid-cycle update in 2019, now being called the Huracán Evo. It now shares its engine and some of the technology with the Performante variant.
The updated version of the Huracán has a more aggressive design language, the new front bumper has integrated aeroblades for improved downforce along with the rear styling inspired by the Performante variant, having the same rear diffuser, exhaust pipe position and radiators. A new ducktail spoiler improves downforce by 5 times as compared to the outgoing model.
The engine is shared with the Performante and generates 471 kW (631 hp; 640 PS) at 8,000 rpm and 601 N⋅m (443 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,500 rpm. The exhaust system is more refined and has titanium intake valves. This allows the car to achieve a 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) acceleration time of 2.9 seconds, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) acceleration time of 9 seconds and a top speed of 325 km/h (202 mph). The car has a braking distance from 100–0 km/h (62–0 mph) of 104 ft (32 m).
The Huracán Evo has a rear-wheel steering system for improved handling and a torque vectoring system. A new central processing unit controls the various functions of the car and monitors various settings. The control system is controlled by the new infotainment system (via an 8.4 inch touchscreen) dubbed the Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo Integrata which has integrated both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The infotainment system predicts the driving modes by a feed forward logic.
The feed forward logic works by sensors monitoring the lateral, longitudinal and vertical accelerations, as well as roll, pitch and yaw rate to predict the best possible driving mode for the driver. The magnetorheological suspension is also revised and now uses electromagnetic current to adjust the suspension system in accordance with the driving mode.
The transmission system from the outgoing model is retained which transfers power to all four wheels. A new Ego mode allows the driver to change driving settings to their own preference.
Huracán Evo Spyder (2019–present)
The Huracán Evo Spyder was introduced online in February 2019. The Spyder has the same enhancements as the coupé but is 100 kg (220 lb) heavier due to the addition of chassis reinforcement components owing to the loss of the roof. The car has the same canvas folding soft top as the outgoing model which takes 17 seconds for operation and is operable at speeds up to 50 km/h (31 mph). The Spyder can accelerate to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.1 seconds from a standstill, to 200 km/h (124 mph) in 9.3 seconds and can attain a top speed of 325 km/h (202 mph).
Huracán Evo RWD (2020–present)
A rear-wheel drive variant of the Evo debuted in January 2020, replacing the LP 580-2. The front splitter has been reshaped and generates more airflow, which is directed to the revised diffuser. Unique to the RWD model is P-TCS (Performance Traction Control System) that ensures that torque is not cut off abruptly; Lamborghini claims this increases oversteer by 30 percent compared to the LP 580-2. The engine is detuned and is now rated at 449 kW (602 hp; 610 PS). Due to the detuned engine, the car is slower than the standard Huracán Evo accelerating to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.3 seconds while having the same top speed. The car also receives a unique paint option, Giallo Belenus, along with a matching interior upholstered in leather and microsuede.
Huracán Evo RWD Spyder (2020–present)
A convertible version of the rear-wheel drive variant of the Evo was showcased in May 2020, replacing the LP 580-2 Spyder. Like the Coupé variant, the convertible has a power output of 449 kW (602 hp; 610 PS). The convertible has a 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) acceleration time of 3.5 seconds and has a claimed top speed of 323 km/h (201 mph).
Huracán STO (2021–present)
The Huracán STO (Super Trofeo Omologato) is a track focused variant of the Huracán. It is completely different from other Huracán variants. The STO has a taller rear wing with a roof snorkel for engine cooling. There is a shark fin aerodynamic device connecting the roof snorkel with the rear wing. The engine cover is reminiscent of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Evo race cars. The entire hood opens to reveal a small compartment for storing racing equipment and the body is made of 75% carbon fibre. The engine and the power output of the STO is the same as the Huracán Perfomante and the Huracán Evo and it has rear-wheel drive with a rear wheel steering system and CCMR Brakes inspired from Formula 1. The STO comes with three new driving modes: STO for road driving, TROFEO for fast lap times on dry tarmac, and PIOGGIA for wet weather driving. The bucket seats on the interior feature racing harnesses.
Huracán Tecnica (2022–present)
Unveiled on April 12, 2022, The Huracán Tecnica sits between the EVO RWD and the track-focused STO. It is 6.1 cm (2.4 in) longer than the EVO, but is the same height and width. It uses the naturally-aspirated V10 engine from the STO and has a top speed of 325 km/h (202 mph) and an acceleration time of 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 3.2 seconds. According to Lamborghini, the Tecnica's aerodynamic changes increase downforce 35 percent and reduce drag by 20 percent compared to the EVO.

Records and controversy
In October 2016, a prototype of the Huracán Performante set a lap time of 6:52.01 on the Nürburgring Nordschleife, with Marco Mapelli behind the wheel, making it one of the world's fastest production cars around the track. This lap was also made on Marco Mapelli's first attempt. However, some critics have stated complaints around the car's lap time, from the official video being sped up to make the lap believable, to the speeds displayed in the video being false or that it did not use road tires. However, Lamborghini was able to prove that the lap the Performante did was fully legitimate exactly a week after the lap around the Nordschleife when they revealed the data to car website Road & Track. Máté Petrány of R&T had met with lead engineer of Lamborghini, Maurizio Reggiani, to ask about the lap. It was then revealed by Reggiani that the Performante's active aerodynamic system called Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva is what gives the car the greatest improvement in lap time. What is more important is the spoilers snapping into their lowest-drag setting when the Performante is aimed forward, which results in the removal of acceleration impediment that big aero causes. The Huracán Performante's lap time was beaten by the Porsche 911 GT2 RS which set a lap time of 6:47.3 in September 2017.
