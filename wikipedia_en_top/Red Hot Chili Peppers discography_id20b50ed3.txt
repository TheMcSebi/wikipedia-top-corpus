The Red Hot Chili Peppers released their first three studio albums—1984's The Red Hot Chili Peppers, 1985's Freaky Styley, and 1987's The Uplift Mofo Party Plan—to virtually no commercial success during the mid to late 1980s. It was not until their fourth studio album, 1989's Mother's Milk, that the band received critical attention when the album peaked at number 52 on the Billboard 200. After releasing their fifth studio album Blood Sugar Sex Magik in September 1991, the Red Hot Chili Peppers broke into the mainstream. "Under the Bridge", the album's second single, peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100. The album went on to sell over seven million copies in the United States (13 million worldwide) and became a foundation for alternative rock in the 1990s. Guitarist John Frusciante quit the band shortly thereafter in 1992 and was replaced by Arik Marshall who was fired in 1993 being briefly replaced by Jesse Tobias before Dave Navarro was hired that same year. The band would release their sixth studio album, One Hot Minute, in September 1995. While the album was a sizable hit, peaking at number four on the US Billboard 200, it failed to match the success of its predecessor Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Navarro was fired in 1998 as the band was starting to work on their follow-up to One Hot Minute.
Frusciante rejoined the Chili Peppers in 1998, and they released their seventh studio album, Californication, in June 1999. It was a commercial success, peaking at number three on the Billboard 200 and being certified six times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album spawned six singles, including the Billboard Hot 100 top ten hit "Scar Tissue". Californication was followed by By the Way in July 2002. By the Way peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 and spawned commercially successful singles such as "By the Way" and "Can't Stop". Stadium Arcadium, the band's ninth studio album, was released in May 2006. It became the band's first album to top the Billboard 200. Stadium Arcadium spawned three straight number-one hits on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart; "Dani California" spent 14 consecutive weeks atop the chart and also peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100. The band entered the studio in September 2010 to record their 10th studio album, and their first with guitarist Josh Klinghoffer. Recording was completed in March 2011, and the album, I'm with You, was released in August 2011. It peaked at number two on the Billboard 200; "The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie", the album's lead single, peaked at number 38 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became the band's 12th number one single on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart, a record they currently hold.
The band released their 11th studio album, their first with producer Danger Mouse and last with Klinghoffer, titled The Getaway in June 2016. Danger Mouse replaced Rick Rubin after 25 years and the previous six albums. "Dark Necessities", the first single from the album, became the band's 13th number-one single on the Alternative Songs chart. The song was also the band's 25th top ten single on the Alternative Songs chart, extending their record over runner-up U2 (23). It also became only the fourth song ever to top the Mainstream Rock, Alternative Songs and Adult Alternative charts at the same time. The song became the Chili Peppers' 30th to chart inside the chart's top 20, which places them one entry below U2, with 3 The Chili Peppers moved into a tie for the third-most Alternative Songs visits, matching Foo Fighters' 31; the leader, again, is U2 at 41, while Pearl Jam has charted 38. The Getaway made its debut at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and it was the band's seventh straight album to chart within the top four dating back to 1991's Blood Sugar Sex Magik. In December 2019, the band announced in a released statement that they were parting ways with Klinghoffer and that John Frusciante was again returning to the band. The band's 12th studio album, Unlimited Love, their first album to be released with Frusciante in 16 years, was released on April 1, 2022.Unlimited Love made its debut at number one on the albums chart in 10 different countries including the United States giving the band their first number one album in their home country since 2006's Stadium Arcadium. The album was preceded by the first single, "Black Summer", which became the band's highest debuting single at number-three and eventually becoming their 14th number-one single and 26th top ten single. It also gave the band a number-one single in four different decades, tying them with Green Day for the most ever on the Alternative Songs chart. The band announced that their 13th album, Return of the Dream Canteen would be released on October 14, 2022. The album was preceded by the first single, "Tippa My Tongue", which became the band's fourth number-one single on the Rock & Alternative Airplay chart and made them the only band with two number-one singles on that chart in 2022. The single also reached number four on the Alternative Airplay chart and became the band's 27th top ten single on that chart which is one shy of the current record held by the Foo Fighters with 28.
