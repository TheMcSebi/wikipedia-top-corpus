Personal life
Relationships
Hyland dated her Geek Charming co-star Matt Prokop for four years after meeting in 2010. In August 2014, Hyland obtained a domestic violence temporary restraining order against Prokop for physically and verbally abusing her throughout the four years of their relationship. In October of that same year, the restraining order became permanent.
Hyland dated her Shadowhunters and Vampire Academy co-star Dominic Sherwood from 2015 until 2017.
In 2017, Hyland began a relationship with Wells Adams, a radio personality and former contestant on The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise. The couple became engaged in July 2019, originally planning to marry in August 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused them to postpone their wedding multiple times. An outdoor bridal shower in early June marked the end of their two-year delay, and the couple were finally married at a California vineyard on August 20, 2022. Their intimate wedding was attended by Hyland's Modern Family co-stars, and officiated by castmate Jesse Tyler Ferguson. They currently reside in Los Angeles.
Health
Hyland was diagnosed with kidney dysplasia as a young child and received a kidney transplant from her father in April 2012. That kidney failed after a few years, leading to a second kidney transplant in September 2017, donated by her younger brother, Ian. Hyland is on regular anti-rejection medicines and steroids to ensure that her body does not reject her donated kidney; consequently, Hyland has difficulty maintaining weight and muscle mass, and has been put on bed-rest several times, sometimes continuing to film Modern Family simultaneously.
In a December 2018 Self magazine article, Hyland said she had contemplated suicide because she felt she was a burden on her family and blamed herself for her body rejecting her father's kidney. Since birth, she has undergone 16 surgeries to improve her health, including numerous kidney surgeries and a laparoscopic surgery to treat her endometriosis.
In 2019, Hyland partnered with Olay for a skin product campaign. In October 2021, she became the new creative director and co-founder of Sourse, a line of chocolate-infused vitamins (including "Beauty Bites" and "Mood Bites").
