Subset
In mathematics, set A is a subset of a set B if all elements of A are also elements of B; B is then a superset of A. It is possible for A and B to be equal; if they are unequal, then A is a proper subset of B. The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called inclusion (or sometimes containment). A is a subset of B may also be expressed as B includes (or contains) A or A is included (or contained) in B. A k-subset is a subset with k elements.
The subset relation defines a partial order on sets. In fact, the subsets of a given set form a Boolean algebra under the subset relation, in which the join and meet are given by intersection and union, and the subset relation itself is the Boolean inclusion relation.
Definition
If A and B are sets and every element of A is also an element of B, then:

If A is a subset of B, but A is not equal to B (i.e. there exists at least one element of B which is not an element of A), then: 
The empty set, written $MATH$ or $MATH$ is a subset of any set X and a proper subset of any set except itself, the inclusion relation $MATH$ is a partial order on the set $MATH$ (the power set of S—the set of all subsets of S) defined by $MATH$. We may also partially order $MATH$ by reverse set inclusion by defining $MATH$
When quantified, $MATH$ is represented as $MATH$


We can prove the statement $MATH$ by applying a proof technique known as the element argument:
The validity of this technique can be seen as a consequence of Universal generalization: the technique shows $MATH$ for an arbitrarily chosen element c. Universal generalisation then implies $MATH$ which is equivalent to $MATH$ as stated above.
The set of all subsets of $MATH$ is called its powerset, and is denoted by $MATH$. The set of all $MATH$-subsets of $MATH$ is denoted by $MATH$, in analogue with the notation for binomial coefficients, which count the number of $MATH$-subsets of an $MATH$-element set. In set theory, the notation $MATH$ is also common, especially when $MATH$ is a transfinite cardinal number.
Properties
⊂ and ⊃ symbols
Some authors use the symbols $MATH$ and $MATH$ to indicate subset and superset respectively; that is, with the same meaning as and instead of the symbols $MATH$ and $MATH$ For example, for these authors, it is true of every set A that $MATH$
Other authors prefer to use the symbols $MATH$ and $MATH$ to indicate proper (also called strict) subset and proper superset respectively; that is, with the same meaning as and instead of the symbols $MATH$ and $MATH$ This usage makes $MATH$ and $MATH$ analogous to the inequality symbols $MATH$ and $MATH$ For example, if $MATH$ then x may or may not equal y, but if $MATH$ then x definitely does not equal y, and is less than y. Similarly, using the convention that $MATH$ is proper subset, if $MATH$ then A may or may not equal B, but if $MATH$ then A definitely does not equal B.

Other properties of inclusion
Inclusion is the canonical partial order, in the sense that every partially ordered set $MATH$ is isomorphic to some collection of sets ordered by inclusion. The ordinal numbers are a simple example: if each ordinal n is identified with the set $MATH$ of all ordinals less than or equal to n, then $MATH$ if and only if $MATH$
For the power set $MATH$ of a set S, the inclusion partial order is—up to an order isomorphism—the Cartesian product of $MATH$ (the cardinality of S) copies of the partial order on $MATH$ for which $MATH$ This can be illustrated by enumerating $MATH$, and associating with each subset $MATH$ (i.e., each element of $MATH$) the k-tuple from $MATH$ of which the ith coordinate is 1 if and only if $MATH$ is a member of T.
