Vistara
Tata SIA Airlines Limited, operating as Vistara, is an Indian full-service airline, based in Gurugram, with its hub at Indira Gandhi International Airport. The carrier, a joint venture between Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines, commenced operations on 9 January 2015 with its inaugural flight between Delhi and Mumbai. The airline had carried more than two million passengers by June 2016 and as of May 2019, has a 4.7% share  of the domestic carrier market, making it the 6th largest domestic airline. The airline serves 34 destinations with a fleet of Airbus A320, Airbus A321neo, Boeing 787-9 and Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.



History
The airline was founded in 2013 as a joint venture (JV) between India's conglomerate Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines (SIA). The two companies had made a bid in the mid-1990s to launch a full-service carrier in India that was unsuccessful, being denied regulatory approval by the Indian government. With India opening up its airline sector for 49 percent foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2012, Tata and SIA once again decided to float a JV airline company in India. The JV, Tata SIA Airlines Limited (TSAL), was envisaged as a premium full-service carrier to cater to the demands of high-end business travellers in India's civil aviation market dominated by low-cost carriers. India's Foreign Investment Promotion Board approved the JV in October 2013, allowing SIA to take a 49 percent stake in the airline. The two parent companies initially pledged to invest a combined US$100mn as start-up capital, with Tata Sons owning 51 percent and Singapore Airlines owning the remaining 49 percent. This was part of Tata's second major foray into the aviation sector along with a minority stake in AirAsia India. The company's first venture, Tata Airlines, was established in the 1930s and later became the flag carrier Air India after nationalization.
The company unveiled its brand identity "Vistara" on 11 August 2014. The name was taken from the Sanskrit word vistāra, meaning "limitless expanse". Vistara received its air operator's certificate from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation on 15 December 2014 and started operations on 9 January 2015. Vistara became the first carrier to operate domestic services out of the new Terminal 2 at Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport. On 24 August 2015, Vistara inaugurated the Aviation Security Training Institute, an in-house institute for training its cockpit and cabin crew, security staff and others related to aviation industry. The institute has secured the necessary approvals from the nodal body Bureau of Civil Aviation Security. From the first month of operation, Vistara consistently achieved very high on-time performance records of over 90 percent, the highest among India's domestic carriers. On 20 August 2015, Vistara declared it had carried half a million passengers in just over seven months of operations. As of February 2016, Vistara has a share of 2% in the domestic carrier market. Vistara recently received the membership of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), joining the association of more than 280 airlines around the world that represents, leads and serves the airline industry. With this, Vistara becomes one of the select few airlines in India to have the IATA membership.
Vistara announced on 11 July 2019 that their first international destination would be Singapore. The airline started its first international service from Delhi to Singapore and Mumbai to Singapore on 6 and 7 August respectively using the Boeing 737-800 NG which was earlier used by Jet Airways.
On 29 February 2020, the airline took the delivery of its first wide-body Boeing 787-9, becoming the first Indian airline to operate this aircraft and yet to receive five more such aircraft. On 28 May 2020, the airline operated its first commercial flight on Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner on Delhi-Kolkata route. On 28 August the same year, the airline started its first intercontinental flight between Delhi and London Heathrow.
After the acquisition of Air India by the Tata group in January 2022, sources reported the chances of a merger between Vistara and Air India. In November 2022, Tata Group and Singapore Airlines confirmed the merger of two airlines into single airline. According to the merger plan, Singapore Airlines will take up to 25.1% of the stake in the airline. The merger is expected to be completed by March 2024.
Corporate affairs
On 15 April 2014, Vistara chose Phee Teik Yeoh as the chief executive officer (CEO) and Giam Ming Toh as the chief commercial officer (CCO), both from Singapore Airlines.
In March 2015, Vistara shifted to its new office at the One Horizon Center tower in Sector 43, Gurgaon, a satellite city of Delhi.  Initially it started out with a three-member board comprising Swee Wah Mak (SIA group), Mukund Rajan and Prasad Menon (Tata group), with the latter as chairman. In August 2015, the airline expanded the board by introducing two new members, Som Mittal and Sangeeta Pendurkar, along with an equity infusion of ₹2 billion (US$25 million), part of ₹5 billion (US$63 million) initially planned by Tata and SIA together. In January 2016, Bhaskar Bhat, present managing director of Titan, joined as the new chairman following Prasad Menon's retirement. In March 2016, Vistara appointed Sanjiv Kapoor as its chief strategy and commercial officer as the successor to Giam Ming Toh who was scheduled to leave in mid-April 2016 following completion of his deputation at Vistara.
On 16 October 2017, it was announced that Leslie Thng would succeed Yeoh Phee Teik as CEO of Vistara. Yeoh returned to Singapore Airlines to take up a senior management role as Acting Senior Vice President of Customer Experience. Thng was serving as Chief Commercial Officer of Budget Aviation Holdings, a Singapore Airlines subsidiary, prior to his appointment in Vistara. Before that, Thng was the chief executive officer of SilkAir, a full-service regional airline under Singapore Airlines. Sanjiv Kapoor resigned from his position as the Chief Commercial Officer of Vistara, on 31 December 2019, with Vinod Kannan, the Chief Strategy Officer, taking up Kapoor's responsibilities.
