Chevrolet Silverado
The Chevrolet Silverado is a range of trucks manufactured by General Motors under the Chevrolet brand.  Introduced for the 1999 model year, the Silverado is the successor to the long running Chevrolet C/K model line.  Taking its name from the top trim level from the Chevrolet C/K series, the Silverado is offered as a series of full-size pickup trucks, chassis cab trucks, and medium-duty trucks.  The fourth generation of the model line was introduced for the 2019 model year.


The Chevrolet Silverado shares mechanical commonality with the GMC Sierra; GMC ended the use of the C/K nomenclature a model generation prior to Chevrolet.  In Mexico, high trim level versions of the Silverado use the Chevrolet Cheyenne name.  Competing against the Ford F-Series, Ram Pickup, Nissan Titan, and Toyota Tundra, the Silverado is among the best-selling vehicles in the United States, having sold over 12 million examples since its introduction in 1999.
History
The Silverado nameplate made its debut for the 1975 model year, becoming the top trim level on all Chevrolet C/K trucks, slotted above Custom Deluxe, Scottsdale, and Cheyenne.  At the same time, GMC C/K trucks used variations of the Sierra name (Sierra, Sierra Classic, Sierra Grande, and High Sierra).  Today, Chevrolet still uses the CK and the CC in their current model codes to denote a 2-wheel rear drive (CC), or a four-wheel drive (CK).
For the 1988 GMT400 model architecture, Chevrolet retained the C/K model nomenclature, with GMC branding its full-size line as Sierras.  While sharing chassis and bodies, the model chronology of the Silverado and Sierra are different, with five generations of the Sierra and four of the Silverado.


In 2018, at the NTEA Work Truck Show in Indianapolis, IN, Chevrolet unveiled the first medium-duty Silverado, expanding the model line to a 4500, 5500, and 6500 chassis cab.  Largely the successor to the 2003-2010 GMT560 chassis, the medium-duty truck is exclusive to Chevrolet, with no plans for an equivalent GMC version. Instead, International would sell the Silverado Medium Duty as a rebadged counterpart, called the "CV".
First-generation Silverado / second-generation Sierra (GMT800; 1999)
The GMT800 Silverado/Sierra 1500 and 2500 pickup trucks were released in August 1998 as 1999 models. The "classic" light-duty GMT400 C/K trucks were continued in production for that first year alongside the new models, and the Heavy-Duty GMT400 pickups (alongside the GMT400 SUVs) were continued until 2000, with the new GMT800 Silverado/Sierra HD (Heavy Duty) released a year later. A small refresh for 2003 models was introduced in 2002, bringing slight design changes and an upgrade to the audio and HVAC controls. The later 2007.5 GMT800 production unit used the name Classic to denote the difference between the first- and second-generation trucks.
Development
In January 1993, GM began development on the GMT800 pickup program with numerous teams coming together.  A new design was chosen and finalized for production in June 1995, 36 months ahead of the scheduled start in June 1998. Development sign-off was issued in late 1997, with pre-production and series production commencement in June 1998.
Light duty
There are a number of models of light-duty Silverados and Sierras, including the half-ton, SS, and Hybrid.
The light-duty trucks use the 1500 name. They are available in three cab lengths, 2-door standard/regular cab, 3 or 4-door extended cab, and later, a front-hinged 4-door crew cab. Three cargo beds are available: a 69.2 in (1,758 mm) short box, 78.7 in (1,999 mm) standard box, and a 97.6 in (2,479 mm) long box. The short box is only available with the crew cab and extended cab.
For the first year, only a regular cab and 3-door extended cab were available, along with the Vortec 4300 V6, Vortec 4800 V8, and the Vortec 5300 V8. In 2000, a driver's side door option became available for the extended cab, giving it four doors, and the crew-cab body was added to the lineup in 2004. Output on the 5.3 L engine also increased to 285 hp (213 kW) and 325 lb⋅ft (441 N⋅m).
The 6.0 L Vortec 6000 V8 was standard on the 2500 and was added for the 2001 Heavy Duty models, rated at 300 hp (224 kW), with the GMC Sierra 1500 C3 getting an uprated 325 hp (242 kW) version of this engine. The Silverado Z71 got an optional lighter composite box, with a suspension package for towing, but lacked the high-output engine. The C3 became the Denali for 2002 (derived from the pre-existing 1999 GMC Yukon Denali), and Quadrasteer was added.
GM introduced a reworked version of the Silverado and Sierra in 2003, with a new front end and a slightly updated rear end. In 2006 the Silverado received another facelift, similar to the HD version introduced on 2005 HD models. In addition to that, Chevrolet has removed their own word scripting off the tailgate that was used from 1998 to 2005. Its SUV counterparts, the Suburban, Tahoe, and Yukon retained the use of the pre-facelift sheet metal.  During the 2005 model year, all light-duty GMT800 pickups reverted to front disc/rear drum brakes as a cost-cutting measure; heavy duty trucks and the SUVs retained their 4-wheel disc brakes.
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gave the Silverado an overall "marginal" score on the frontal offset crash test for poor structural integrity and poor dummy control, although no injuries were recorded on the dummy's body regions.
2001 GMC Sierra C3/Denali
GMC created an upscale version of its Sierra 1500 in 2001 called the Sierra C3. It used all-wheel drive with a 3.73 final drive gear ratio and included the 6.0 L Vortec 6000 LQ4 V8 rated at 325 hp (242 kW) at 5000 rpm and 370 lb•ft (502 N·m) of torque at 4000 rpm. It was coupled to a 4L60E-HD 4-speed automatic transmission along with other upscale equipment. For 2002, the name was changed to Sierra Denali, but the specifications remained essentially the same except for the addition of Quadrasteer and GM changed from the 4L60E-HD to the 4L65E in conjunction with a 4.10 final drive gear ratio.
The Denali is rated for towing 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) and hauling 1,840 pounds (830 kg) in the cargo box.
The Sierra Denali was initially equipped with Delphi's Quadrasteer system as standard equipment. It was a 4-wheel steering system that greatly reduced the truck's turning radius and improved lane changing while towing. General Motors dropped Quadrasteer from the Sierra Denali after the 2004 model year and its entire lineup after 2005 due to poor sales of this expensive option.
Chevrolet Silverado SS
Launched in early 2003, the Silverado SS is a high-performance pickup truck built by Chevrolet. It is based on the Silverado 1500 Extended Cab with a Fleetside Box and features upgrades in the drivetrain and both exterior and interior appearance. It was equipped standard with the 6.0-liter Vortec High-Output V8 rated at 345 hp (257 kW) at 5200 rpm and 380 lb⋅ft (515 N⋅m) of torque at 4000 rpm coupled to a 4L65E four-speed automatic transmission. This was the same engine used for the second generation Cadillac Escalade and GMC Yukon Denali. Chevrolet and GMC advertised this engine as the Vortec High Output and later as the "VortecMAX", while Cadillac calls it the "HO 6000". The SS debuted in 2003 with a standard All Wheel Drive setup with a 4.10 final drive gear ratio and 4-wheel disc brakes. In 2005, in an attempt to increase sales, a 2-wheel drive version became available (the 2WD SS also lost its rear disc brakes in favor of drums, as did the rest of the 1/2-ton GMT800s). 2005 was also the first year the sunroof was available in the SS line up. In 2006, the AWD variant was dropped, and the rear wheel drive was the only driveline layout available. In a further effort to reduce cost, buyers could also choose cloth interior and/or a bench seat.  The Silverado SS also comes with the Z60 performance suspension and 20-inch aluminum wheels. All the SS trucks in both 2-wheel drive and AWD used the torsion bar style front suspension for better handling. SS themed trucks were only available from the factory in Black, Victory Red, and Arrival Blue Metallic from 2003 to 2004. In 2005, Arrival Blue Metallic was dropped from the color choices and replaced with Silver Birch Metallic.
Intimidator SS
In 2006, Chevrolet released a special edition Silverado SS under the name "Intimidator SS" (licensed by Dale Earnhardt, Inc.) to honor the late Dale Earnhardt.  The truck came with several minor appearance upgrades (rear spoiler, embroidered headrests, Intimidator custom badging), but was essentially a standard Silverado SS. Of the 1,033 scheduled trucks, only 933 were made (the remaining 100 were sold as 2007 Silverado SS "Classic" body style trucks before the 2007.5 MY changeover. These trucks were only available in Black exterior but could be ordered with cloth or leather interior.
Vortec High Output/Vortec Max
The Vortec High Output option was first introduced in 2004 to a limited market (mainly consisting of Texas and several surrounding areas); it was available nationwide for MY 2005. It was available for both the Chevy and GMC for 1500 series trucks. This special edition package (under option code B4V) included several options previously not found on the standard 1500 model, most notably the LQ9 6.0 L V8 engine (the same used for the Silverado SS, the Cadillac Escalade, and GMC Yukon Denali). The LQ9 motor was rated at 345 hp (257 kW) at 5200 rpm and 380 lb⋅ft (515 N⋅m) of torque at 4000 rpm, which was the same specifications shared in the SS models. The B4V package could only be ordered on extended cab standard box 2WD trucks. They were all built at the Canadian assembly plant and were equipped with the Z60 High Performance suspension package, in addition to the M32 = 4L65E transmission, GT4 = 3.73 rear gear, and G80 Gov Lock as standard equipment. The 2004 models were equipped with the standard 10 bolt 8.625 rear end. The 2005 models were upgraded with the larger 14 bolt 9.5 rear end under RPO option AXN. The package also included one style of the newly introduced GM 20-inch wheels installed from the factory. This marked the first time the LQ9 engine was available for a two-wheel drive application. Unlike the previous years with the SS Package, interior choices ranged from basic cloth to fully loaded. There were also more exterior color options available with this package.
In 2006, the Vortec Max trailering package became available. The Vortec Max package was added to the option list with an array of similar features and new badges, and at its core retained the LQ9/4L65-E powertrain.  However, the Vortec Max package differed from the Performance edition in that it also came with a variant of the Z85 Handling/Trailering suspension, as well as 17-inch wheels and tires under the option code NHT (and was available on 4x4 models in addition to 4x2 trucks) versus the Z60 High Performance Suspension and 20-inch wheel and tire package of the regular B4V (which was limited to 2-wheel drive trucks).  This was because the Vortec Max package was intended for max trailer towing, while the Performance Edition was intended more for customers who wanted the Silverado SS mechanicals without the visuals of the SS.  It was also made available (in addition to the extended cab) in the light-duty 4-door crew cab models.  Towing capacity with the VortecMax Trailing package was 10,800 pounds.
Hybrid
GM launched a hybrid version of the Silverado/Sierra in 2004, becoming the first ever GM hybrid passenger vehicle. Known within GM as the Parallel Hybrid Truck or PHT, it is not actually a parallel hybrid by the current definition, but a type of micro hybrid design. The electric motor housed within the transmission flywheel housing, serves only to provide engine cranking/starting, battery charging, and powering accessories. The engine automatically shuts down as the truck comes to a stop and uses 42 Volt electric power to the starter/generator unit to restart the engine as the brake pedal is released. Besides the typical 12 V automotive battery the PHT uses three additional 14 V valve regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries mounted under the rear seat to store and provide power. The truck uses a 5.3 L Vortec 5300 V8 for primary propulsion power. These trucks were also purchased back from customers for more than what they were worth in the late 2000s.
The PHT features four 120-volt 20 amp AC outlets, two in the bed and two inside the cab under the rear seat. These are particularly interesting to the building/construction contractor market, since they often require AC power when on the job. Additionally, the extra reserves of power for the accessories make this truck well-suited to that market, where trucks often sit at idle for hours at a time.
Availability was extremely limited at first, with commercial buyers getting the first allotment. Later in 2005, the truck was offered at retail in Alaska, California, Florida, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Canada. For 2006–07 the truck was generally available to retail buyers throughout North America. The Parallel Hybrid Truck was discontinued for the 2008 model year with the release of the GMT900 truck line. Starting in 2009, General Motors offers a second-generation Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra equipped with a Two-Mode Hybrid powertrain and CVT.
Heavy Duty
The HD variant is a heavy-duty truck. On Crew Cabs, they were a strengthened version of the Silverado/Sierra light-duty, and was available in the 1500HD, 2500HD, and 3500HD models. The 1500HD, introduced in 2000, offered a Vortec 6000 V8 with 300 hp (224 kW) at 5200 rpm and 360 lb⋅ft (488 N⋅m) of torque at 4000 rpm with a Hydra-Matic 4L80E four-speed automatic transmission. The 2500HD also offered the LB7 Duramax V8 with 300 hp (224 kW) at 3100 rpm and 520 lb⋅ft (705 N⋅m) of torque at 1800 rpm, the LLY Duramax V8 with 310 hp (231 kW) at 3000 rpm and 605 lb·ft (820 N·m) at 1600 rpm, and the LBZ Duramax V8 with 360 hp (268 kW) at 3200 rpm and 650 lb·ft (881 N·m) at 1600 rpm. Also available was the Vortec 8100 V8 with 340 hp (254 kW) at 4200 rpm and 455 lb⋅ft (617 N⋅m) of torque at 3200 rpm.
The 2500HD had an available five-speed (six-speed for 2006–2007 models) Allison 1000 transmission with the Vortec 8100 and 6.6L Duramax. The Silverado 3500 offered the same engines and transmissions that the 2500HD used. However, it was usually equipped with "dually" twin wheels at the rear and had a stronger suspension. The HD models were primarily used for towing and high-weight cargo. The Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD came in at #2 in a 2016 study by iSeeCars.com ranking the top 10  longest-lasting vehicles. The Silverado 2500HD had 5.7% of vehicles over 200,000 miles, according to the iSeeCars study.:)
For 2002, GMC introduced a new limited edition Sierra Professional. Built as either a 1500 or 2500HD Extended Cab Standard Box model with two and four-wheel-drive, the Professional was the ultimate contractor's truck. The center console area provided an area to store PDAs, cell phones and laptop computers as well as extra charging points for them and an area to hang file folders. There were also extra storage trays and larger cupholders throughout the cab, including one temperature controlled cupholder. The exterior featured lower body cladding, Professional badging, and a full-chrome grille. These trucks also featured a standard bedliner, box-rail protectors, in-bed power outlet, and many optional accessories suited to tradesmen (ladder racks, toolboxes, etc.). The 1500 series came standard with the 5.3L Vortec 5300 V8, but the 4.8L V8 could be ordered with an option credit if so desired. 2500HD models came with the 6.0L Vortec 6000 V8 only. All trucks had the four-speed automatic transmission with tow/haul mode. Customers could choose from either SLE or SLT decor. The base price for a 2002 1500 2WD with SLE decor was $29,591. 2003 was the final year the Professional was offered.
Towing capacity for the 1500HD is rated at 10,300 pounds (4,700 kg) and can haul 3,129 pounds (1,419 kg) in the bed depending on options. Towing capacity for the 2500HD is rated at 16,100 pounds (7,300 kg) with the gasoline 8.1L V8 with 3.73:1 rear and can haul 3,964 pounds (1,798 kg) in the bed depending on options. Towing capacity for the 3500HD is rated at 16,700 pounds (7,600 kg) and can haul 5,753 pounds (2,610 kg) in the bed depending on options. The addition of 4 wheel drive tends to reduce the towing and carrying capacity by 200 to 400 lb (181 kg), depending upon year and model. Other factors, such as options, can also affect these numbers.
2003 facelift
For 2003, along with all GMT800-based full-size pickup trucks and SUVs, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra models received a mid-cycle facelift. All Silverados and Sierras received a revised front end design, as well as new tail lamps, and most models also received new wheel designs. The interior was also redesigned, with a new dashboard design that included a new instrument cluster with an optional enhanced Driver Information Center (DIC), and a new four-spoke steering wheel. New audio system options for 2003 included newly-available XM Satellite Radio capabilities, as well as a Bose premium audio system, and an integrated six-disc CD changer. All trucks also received new front seats with new upholstery designs and color schemes. New for 2003 was a Work Truck (WT; or W/T) trim that was offered alongside the Base trim, and later became the new "Base model" Silverado and Sierra. The Silverado 1500 lineup received a new "SS" trim that included the 6.0L LQ9 Vortec V8 gasoline engine, while the LT model was divided into LT1, LT2, and LT3 trims. Other additions to the powertrain lineup for 2003 included a new E85 (FlexFuel)-capable version of the 5.3L Vortec V8 gasoline engine, which was available in non-California emissions states.
Second-generation Silverado / third-generation Sierra (GMT900; 2007)
The all-new GMT900 generation of the Silverado/Sierra arrived in the last quarter of 2006 as a 2007 model. It features a redesigned exterior, interior, frame, and suspension as well as power increases on certain engines. Like previous generations, it takes styling cues from the GMT900 SUVs of the same year. And otherwise, the Chevrolet Colorado/GMC Canyon pickups. Like the GMT900 SUVs, these pickups also have greatly improved aerodynamics over their predecessors like steeply raked windshields and tighter panel gaps which improve fuel economy. The previous GMT800 models were continued through 2007 badged as "Classic", just as the GMT400 models continued for two years after the GMT800's introduction.
The new Silverado earned the North American Truck of the Year award for 2007 and was Motor Trend magazine's Truck of the Year for 2007. Like its predecessors, the new Silverado offers buyers a choice of two-door regular cabs, four-door extended cabs (with front-opening rear doors that now open 170 degrees similar to the Nissan Titan) and four-door crew cabs. GM also offers the trucks in the traditional two- and four-wheel-drive configurations.
For the 2007 model year, the Sierra Denali shares the same billet grille from the other Denali models, and also has the same dash as the 2007 SUV's. The 2007 Sierra Denali was initially the only half-ton pickup that had a 6.2L V8 engine with 403 hp (301 kW) and 417 lb⋅ft (565 N⋅m) of torque coupled to a six-speed automatic transmission. This truck is also an optional all-wheel-drive vehicle and goes 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 6.3 seconds.
The Generation III small block V8 engines offered in the GMT800 trucks were replaced in the GMT900 series by the Generation IV small block V8 engine family, featuring upgrades such as increased power and Active Fuel Management on the 5.3 L and 6.0 L V8s. A new high performance 6.2 liter V8 (with 403 hp (301 kW) and 417 lb⋅ft (565 N⋅m) of torque)  was introduced with the 2007 Cadillac Escalade and 2007 GMC Denali line, and was made available in the Silverado 1500 for MY 2009.
After skipping the 2008 model year, with 2007 being the last for the GMT800 hybrid line, a two-mode hybrid model was introduced in late 2008 as a 2009 model. General Motors discontinued the Silverado Hybrid due to poor sales along with the GMC Sierra Hybrid, Chevy Avalanche, Chevy Tahoe Hybrid, GMC Yukon Hybrid, Cadillac Escalade Hybrid, and Cadillac Escalade EXT after the 2013 model year although it was the one of the first two hybrid pickup trucks ever manufactured. Available in either two- or four-wheel-drive, the Sierra 1500 Hybrid is powered by a 6.0-liter V8. It's joined by two 60-kilowatt electric motors supplied by a nickel–metal hydride battery pack under the rear seat. On its own, the V8 is rated at 332 horsepower and 367 pound-feet of torque. GM engineers say that combined output with the electric motors is 379 hp. The unique transmission houses the electric motors along with three different planetary gear sets and four traditional clutches.
There were two dash options offered in this model Silverado and Sierra: a luxury-inspired dash that closely mimics the dash in their GMT900 SUVs, and a more traditional upright dash to make room for a passenger seat in place of a center console.
As of 2008, GM full-size trucks were no longer sold in United States and Canada with manual transmissions; they were only offered in Mexico in the Silverado 1500 V6 engine and Silverado 3500.
All Silverado and Sierra 1/2-ton models received a revised bumper and shortened front fascia for the 2009 model year, and extended and crew cab models equipped with the Vortec 5300 V8 received a new six-speed 6L80 automatic transmission. The Vortec 6200 V8 was made available for LTZ and SLT models. Bluetooth was added to the equipment list, becoming standard on Denali, SLT, and LTZ - and optional on SLE and LT, as was an optional rear vision camera. An integrated trailer brake controller, first available on the Silverado and Sierra HD for 2007, is now an option on 1500 series trucks. The XFE package was new for 2009, available only on Silverado 1500 Crew Cab LT 2-wheel-drive models, it included the 5.3L Vortec V8, soft tonneau cover, XFE badging, aluminum wheels, and low rolling resistance tires.
A refresh followed with all 2010 models, including new interior door panels (which moved the handle forward and added an additional cup holder), and a six-speed automatic transmission on Regular Cab models with the 5.3L V8 was also made standard. The Vortec 6200 V8 was given wider availability, now being optional on LT and SLE Extended and Crew Cabs, completely supplanting the light-duty Vortec 6000 V8 in the process. The new Z71 Appearance Package was optional on LT and LTZ, it included: body-color grille and front fascia, body-color door handles and mirror caps, unique Z71 box side decals, chrome sill plates, and a unique Z71 gauge cluster.  Two new exterior colors were added: Taupe Gray Metallic and Sheer Silver Metallic.
For 2012, the Sierra and Silverado 1500 received another refresh. This time the Silverado was given new grille and front fascia treatments for both LT and LTZ models. A newly redesigned touch-screen navigation radio was optional on LTZ, SLT, and Denali. Trailer sway control and hill start assist are now standard on all models. Cooled seats were made optional on LTZ and SLT and the woodgrain trim was replaced with brushed aluminum.
Heavy-Duty
For the first time, the 8.1 L big block V8 is no longer offered on the Heavy-Duty models, and no replacement has been announced. The 6L90 6-speed automatic transmission is standard in all Heavy-Duty models. The Allison 1000 transmission is paired with the optional Duramax V8 diesel.
As of 2011, the GMC and Chevrolet Heavy Duty models have been upgraded with a new fully boxed high strength steel frame from front to rear improving stiffness by 92% with bigger rear springs, larger engine and transmission mounts and new hydraulic body mounts to improve the ride. The front suspension incorporates new upper and lower control arms and new torsion bars tailored to one of five different gross axle weight ratings. Upper control arms are constructed from forged steel that is both stronger and lighter than the previous arms, while the new lower arms are cast iron to maximize load capacity. Using a unique torsion bar for each gross weight rating allows for better control over vehicle height, resulting in improved handling and better alignment for reduced tire wear. These improvements allow for up to a 6,000-pound front axle weight rating, allowing all 4wd trucks to accommodate a snowplow.
Additional front suspension enhancements come from new urethane bump stops, two per side. The upper shock mount has been changed from a single stem mount to a two-bolt design to eliminate the possibility of squeaks and thumps.
The rear suspension design uses asymmetrical leaf springs that are wider and capable of greater load handling. The design features 3-inch-wide leaves, with front and rear spring sections of different lengths to reduce the twisting that can result in axle hop and loss of traction. The 2500HD uses a two-stage design with a rating of 6,200 lb (2,812 kg), and 3500HD models have a three-stage design with 7,050 lb (3,198 kg) and 9,375 lb (4,252 kg) ratings on single and dual-wheel models, respectively.
Production location switch
For the 2011 model year of the Silverado/Sierra, the production of 1500 crew cab models partially moved from Silao, Mexico to Flint, Michigan.
Safety
The Silverado comes standard with four-wheel ABS. StabiliTrak and side curtain airbags are optional on certain trim levels.
2007 NHTSA crash test:
The IIHS gave the Silverado a "Good" score in their frontal crash test. The 2007-09 models equipped with or without optional side curtain airbags received a "Poor" rating in the side impact test.  For 2010, the side structure was strengthened, side torso air bags were added, and side airbags became standard leading to the IIHS side impact overall rating improving to "Acceptable" and the overall side structure rating improved from "Poor" to "Acceptable".  The crew cab variant of the 2011-13 Silverado is also rated "Marginal" in the IIHS roof strength test.
Electric version
In 2011 developer of the Chevrolet Volt and former vice chairman Bob Lutz joined VIA Motors in developing electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra called VIA VTrux.
Third-generation Silverado / fourth-generation Sierra (K2XX; 2014)
On December 13, 2012, the redesigned 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra were both introduced in Detroit, Michigan, later making their public debut at the North American International Auto Show. GM dropped the 900 platform and changed to K2XX. The third generation Silverado 1500 has three gas engine options; a 4.3 L EcoTec3 V6, a 5.3 L EcoTec3 V8, and a 6.2 L EcoTec3 V8. Chevrolet's MyLink touch-screen multimedia interface system became available on most models. It included A2DP stereo streaming technologies, Bluetooth hands-free telephone, USB hookups, and an input for an Apple iPod or iPhone. When connected via the USB port, an iPhone 4/4S, iPhone 5/iPhone 5S, iPhone 6, or iPhone 6 Plus is able to stream music from Pandora Radio. A Bose premium audio system, as well as a Bose surround sound audio system is available on most models. OnStar became standard on all models.
Underneath, the Silverado rides on a fully boxed high-strength steel frame with hydroforming technology; truck cab's frame is built with high strength steel as well. The third generation Silverado uses aluminum on the hood, for the engine block and for the control arms in order to save mass. The truck's bed is made of roll-formed steel instead of stamped steel used by other manufacturers in order to save weight and gain strength. The third generation Silverado introduced the all-new upmarket top-of-the-line "High Country" trim level which includes saddle brown leather interior, which is Chevrolet's first entry into the luxury truck market. A fully-squared front end takes styling cues from the 1994-1998 C/K trucks, and, on Z71 models, a Z71 badge was added to the front grille. The first production Silverado completed assembly on April 29, 2013. The Silverado 1500 went on sale in May 2013 as a 2014 model, with the Silverado HD being available in early 2014 for the 2015 model year. On January 10, 2014, a recall was issued for 370,000 Silverado and Sierra pickups due to a fire risk.
The American model version of the 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500/2500HD/3500HD and the 2015 Chevrolet Silverado High Country was introduced to the Philippines market by Chevrolet Motorama Show late November 2014 as a MY2015, along with the MY2015 Chevrolet Suburban, 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe, 2015 Chevrolet Impala, 2015 Chevrolet Express Van, 2015 Chevrolet Trax and 2015 Chevrolet Colorado.
On January 14, 2014, The Silverado, along with the Chevrolet Corvette Stingray, received the 2014 North American International Auto Show's Car and Truck of the Year awards.
For 2018, this generation of Silverado was officially exported to Australia and converted to the right-hand-drive and Australian Design Rules (ADR) by General Motors Australian subsidiary, Holden Special Vehicles (HSV). In the past, several independent specialists imported and converted Silverado and GMC Sierra for Australian and right-hand-drive markets. The 2500HD and 3500HD were fitted with 6.6-liter/litre Duramax diesel V8, the sole engine choice for Australia. No 1500 version was offered.
2015
For the 2015 model year, the 6.2L EcoTec3 was paired with the new 8-speed 8L90 transmission, offering a wider ratio spread with more closely spaced gears, quicker shifts, improved acceleration, and fuel economy. The Silverado 2500HD/3500HD models continue to use the 6.0L L96 flex fuel capable Vortec engine combined with the 6L90E transmission, installed with engine oil and transmission fluid coolers for hauling/towing applications. The 6.6L Duramax also continued to be backed by the 6-speed Allison 1000 automatic.
The GMC Sierra 2500HD/3500HD were the first "heavy-duty" trucks to offer an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), a Forward Collision Warning System (FCWS), and a Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) available together as part of the available Driver Assist Package. The Driver Assist Package was standard equipment on the GMC Sierra 2500HD/3500HD Denali, and optional on most other Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD/3500HD and GMC Sierra 2500HD/3500HD models. Other new options for the Silverado and Sierra 2500HD/3500HD models included an eight-inch, full-color, reconfigurable LCD Driver Information Center (DIC) screen (for Sierra 2500HD/3500HD Denali models only), a 110-Volt AC household-style power outlet, up to six available USB ports, an available eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system, and a power-sliding rear window with integrated defroster.
In mid-year 2015, Chevrolet and GMC made enhancements to the all-new Silverado 2500HD/3500HD and Sierra 2500HD/3500HD. Some of these enhancements included a new OnStar telematics system with 4G LTE Wi-Fi capabilities, new wheel designs, new exterior paint color options, new exterior tow mirror designs, a USB port added the glove compartment of trucks equipped with a front bench seat, DURALIFE brake rotors, the availability of dual 150 and 220 amp alternators for models equipped with the 6.6L Duramax Turbodiesel V8 engine, an off-road information screen added to the instrument cluster of 4X4 models equipped with the Z71 or All-Terrain Packages (the latter is a GMC-only option), a Bi-Fi Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) option for models equipped with the 6.0L Vortec gasoline V8 engine, a new All-Terrain Package available on SLE and SLT Double Cab and Crew Cab models (for GMC models only), a standard heavy-duty locking rear axle for all models, and the removal of HD Radio from the "up-level" IO5 and IO6 infotainment systems. A Regular Production Option (RPO) Code of "AVF" in the upper glove compartment distinguishes early-build 2015 models from their 2015.5 successors.

2019 Silverado LD
Chevrolet continued production of the third-generation Silverado 1500 for 2019, which was sold alongside the all-new, fourth-generation 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500. Renamed the Chevrolet Silverado LD ("LD" for Light Duty), production of the previous-generation truck moved from Fort Wayne, Indiana to Oshawa Car Assembly, Ontario, Canada. Only available in a Double Cab/Standard Box configuration, the Silverado LD ended production in December 2019.
The first-generation Chevrolet Silverado 1500 was sold alongside the second-generation Chevrolet Silverado 1500 for the 2007 model year as the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Classic, and 2500 and 3500 versions of the truck were also sold alongside their successors, the Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and 3500. GMC also offered versions of their Sierra trucks as the Sierra Classic for 2007 as well, and did the same for 2019, offering the predecessor generation model as the 2019 GMC Sierra 1500 Limited.
Fourth-generation Silverado / fifth-generation Sierra (T1XX; 2019)
On December 16, 2017, Chevrolet unveiled the all-new, fourth-generation 2019 Silverado 1500 at its Chevy Truck Centennial Celebration Weekend at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Texas. The reveal of the all-new Silverado was not expected until early 2018. For its debut, the Silverado 1500 was airlifted via helicopter onto a stage, where it was introduced to a crowd of Chevrolet truck owners and enthusiasts, as well as to the automotive press. Chevrolet NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. also spoke at the event. In addition to the reveal of the 2019 Silverado 1500, multiple Chevrolet trucks of different generations were on display as well.
The model shown at the reveal was the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LT Trail Boss, which is a factory-modified version of the Silverado 1500 LT Z71. Distinguishing features of the Trail Boss from other Silverado 1500 trim levels are its gloss black front fascia, black rear step bumper, black Chevrolet "bow-tie" emblems on the front grille and rear tailgate, gloss black-finished aluminum-alloy wheels, large off-road tires, altered suspension, "Trail Boss" decals on the sides of the pickup box, front bumper-mounted center fog lamps, "Z71" emblems on each front fender, and red-painted front tow hooks.
The formal unveiling of the Silverado 1500 took place at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan on January 13, 2018, exactly 100 years after Chevrolet delivered its first trucks to customers on January 13, 1918. The model was unveiled as a Silverado LT Trail Boss 4X4 model.
Sales to customers began in August 2018 as an early 2019 model year vehicle with a base price of $32,200 MSRP.
The Silverado 1500 features a more sculpted exterior design, with front headlamps that integrate into the front grille, which also incorporate LED Daytime Running Accent Lamps (DRL's).
Silverado 1500 has been launched in Australia for the first time for 2020 model year. Holden Special Vehicles (to be renamed as General Motors Specialty Vehicles for 2021) has started the conversion to right-hand-drive and Australian Design Rules. The 6.2L V8 engine is the sole engine choice at the launch.
Trims
The Silverado 1500 will be available in eight distinct trim levels: WT, Custom, Custom Trail Boss, LT, RST, LT Trail Boss, LTZ, and High Country.
All trim levels include a next-generation touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth for hands-free calling and wireless audio streaming via A2DP, power windows and door locks (on Double and Crew Cab models), air conditioning, and a rearview backup camera system.

This is the second-time Chevrolet and Realtree have teamed up to produce a special edition Silverado truck, having done so for 2016. The 2021 model is based on a Silverado 1500 Crew Cab Custom Trail Boss, adding 20-inch black wheels and Realtree camouflage graphics inside and out.
Engines
The all-new 2019 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 1500 offers a choice of six different engine options, dependent upon trim level. The base engine on lower trim levels is the 285-horsepower, 4.3L EcoTec3 FlexFuel-Capable V6 gasoline engine. Standard on mid-level trims is an all-new, 310-horsepower, 2.7L Turbocharged Inline Four Cylinder (I4) gasoline engine that is the smallest engine available on a half-ton pickup, and features cylinder deactivation for improved fuel economy. Optional on most trim levels is the 355-horsepower, 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 gasoline engine, which is optionally FlexFuel-Capable, and features either a carryover Active Fuel Management (AFM) system, or a brand-new Dynamic Fuel Management system (DFM), which now can shut off up to 6 of 8 cylinders. The availability of either AFM or DFM is dependent on trim level, with WT and Custom trucks available with AFM, and LT and above trucks standard with DFM. Optional on upper-level trims is a 420-horsepower, 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 gasoline engine with Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM). An all-new, 277-horsepower 3.0L Turbocharged Duramax I6 engine became available for the 2020 model year. Availability of this engine had been delayed due to EPA certification. All engines are paired to either a 6-speed, 8-speed, or 10-speed automatic transmission, with a choice of either two-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive (4X4 is standard equipment on Silverado 1500 Custom Trail Boss and LT Trail Boss trims, and optional on all other Silverado 1500 and Sierra 1500 models). For 2020, availability of both the 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 gasoline engine and the 10-speed automatic transmission will expand to most Silverado 1500 and Sierra 1500 trim levels.
According to EPA ratings, rear drive 2019 Silverado models with the 2.7-liter turbo-four engine can achieve 20/23 mpg city/highway.

Safety
Advanced, active safety features included in the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado are:
Chevrolet Silverado HD
Chevrolet released three all-new 2020 Silverado models, including the Silverado 2500 HD and 3500 HD, in 2019. Chevrolet debuted the truck at GM's Flint, Michigan plant on February 5, 2019. The trucks had made their arrival at the dealerships in the late summer of 2019.

GMC Sierra
The fifth-generation GMC Sierra was unveiled in Detroit on March 1, 2018. The Sierra 1500 will differentiate itself from its Chevrolet Silverado 1500 counterpart by offering unique features, such as a two-piece tailgate, a pickup bed constructed from carbon fiber, a 3" x 7" multi-color Heads-Up Display, a rear-view mirror backup camera system, and a luxury Denali trim level. The Sierra 1500 will also feature its own distinct exterior styling, though interior styling will be similar to that of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500.
There are six functions of GMC Sierra's Multi-Pro Tailgate including a primary tailgate load stop for large items. Its inner tailgate can be a load stopper, a full-width step, and a work area by dropping down the load stop or provide easy access to the bed just by folding down the inner tailgate.
Powertrains include improved versions of the current 5.3L and 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 gasoline engines, as well as the same 3.0L Duramax Turbocharged Diesel I6 engine that will also be available in the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500. An all-new, ten-speed automatic transmission will come as standard equipment on gasoline-powered Sierra 1500 models. Availability of the previous 4.3L EcoTec3 V6 gasoline engine was not announced at launch.
All trim levels include a next-generation touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth for hands-free calling and wireless audio streaming via A2DP, power windows and door locks (on Double and Crew Cab models), air conditioning, and a rear-view backup camera system.

The 2019 GMC Sierra went on sale in September 2018 as an early 2019 model year vehicle at GMC dealerships nationwide.
Regular Cab
Initially unavailable at launch, the all-new 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 regular cab configuration went on sale in early 2019. Only available with an 8 ft (2.4 m) pickup box, with a choice of two-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive and the 4.3L EcoTec3 V6 or 5.3L V8 gasoline engines, the regular cab is exclusively available in W/T trim (1WT) for Silverado 1500, or Sierra (1SA) trim for Sierra 1500. The regular cab option is unavailable in other trim levels in the United States and Canada, as these trucks will appeal mainly towards fleet and commercial buyers. Regular cab models with a 6.5 ft (2.0 m) bed and in higher trim levels are produced but are only available for sale in Mexico and the Middle East.
Standard features include a black front grille, black front and rear bumpers, 17" steel wheels, manual windows and door locks, manual black side mirrors, a seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with rearview backup camera and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, vinyl seating surfaces, a split front bench seat, vinyl flooring, and air conditioning.

2020 changes
The 2020 Silverado sees deletion of the Oakwood Metallic exterior paint color. Major additions are new vertical trailering mirrors, which include power adjustability, as well as power-folding and power-extension capabilities. Adaptive Cruise control is optional on the LTZ and High Country trim levels, and SiriusXM 360L capability is available on LT and higher trims. Silverado 1500s lose the keyless access buttons on the rear doors.
The Sierra sees a new Carbon Black Metallic paint color in addition to the above-mentioned Silverado updates.
2020 is the final model year for Double Cab 1500 models in LTZ, SLT, and AT4 trims.
2021 changes
For 2021, the Silverado and Sierra pickups saw relatively few changes. Most notably, the Silverado 1500 offers the newly named Multi-Flex six-position tailgate, which is borrowed from the GMC Sierra, and the introduction of wireless CarPlay and Android Auto projection capability. 2.7L 4-cylinder and 3.0L Duramax diesel-equipped Silverado and Sierra models see increased tow capacity ratings and new towing technology, including a jack-knife alert and trailer length indicator. Several colors were changed on the Silverado; Havana Brown Metallic and Cajun Red Tintcoat are replaced by Oxford Brown Metallic and Cherry Red Tintcoat, respectively, and Mosaic Black Metallic is a new addition. 2021 Sierra models received color changes as well; Deep Mahogany Metallic, Red Quartz Tintcoat, and Carbon Black Metallic are replaced with Brownstone Metallic, Cayenne Red Tintcoat, and Ebony Twilight Metallic, respectively. Smokey Quartz Metallic was removed from the available color options and Hunter Metallic was added as a new paint color. For the 2021 GMC Sierra, the previously un-named "Sierra" trim becomes the "Pro".
Forward Collision Alert, Automatic Emergency Braking, and Front Pedestrian Braking options are now available on Silverado WT and Custom trim levels as part of the Safety Confidence Package. Crew Cab Standard Box Sierra 1500 models are now only available in four wheel-drive.
Silverado and Sierra 3500HD dually models see an increase in max-towing capacity to 36,000 pounds.
Due to the global microchip shortage, some 2021 Silverado and Sierra vehicles are built without options like Automatic Start-stop and heated and ventilated front seats, heated outboard rear seats, and heated steering wheel.
2022 changes
The 2022 Chevy Silverado LTD and GMC Sierra Limited will enter the model lineup as a stop-gap measure until production of the newly refreshed 2022 model begins. As such, the 2022 Silverado LTD and Sierra Limited have very few changes from the 2021 models.
Notable changes for the 2022 Limited models include the deletion of both the 4.3L LV3 EcoTec3 V6 and 5.3L L82 EcoTec3 V8 with active fuel management (AFM) gasoline engines, which have been discontinued, as well as the previous "6L80" six-speed automatic transmission, leaving only eight-speed and ten-speed units. The LT Trail Boss trim-level (Chevrolet) is now available with the 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel engine.
2022 refresh
For the 2022 model year, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 receives a mid-cycle refresh that includes the following new trim levels for the Chevrolet Silverado, called the ZR2, and for the GMC Sierra, called the AT4X and Denali Ultimate. The refresh also includes a new front-end design, as well as a revised interior. All trucks equipped with front bucket seats receive a new center console-mounted transmission shift lever (trucks equipped with a front bench seat retain the previous column-mounted gear selector lever). The 3.0L Duramax turbocharged diesel Inline Six-Cylinder (I6) engine now has expanded availability on more trim levels.
The short six-foot pickup box option has returned available for the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 Regular Cabs since last offered for the 2018 previous generation, which was previously only available in Mexico and the Middle East and is only available with the W/T and Pro trims of the Silverado and Sierra, respectively (these trims also remain the only trims available in the Regular Cab body style). Base Silverado 1500 WT and Sierra 1500 Pro Regular Cab models now receive standard power windows, door locks and push-button start, although keyless entry remains an extra-cost option. All models from the LT (Silverado) and SLE (Sierra) and above receive a newly standard 13.4-inch touchscreen infotainment system, which includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration and SiriusXM Satellite Radio with 360L (up-level models also receive connected GPS navigation), while base models retain the previously standard seven-inch touchscreen display. A new Silverado 1500 ZR2 model becomes the most off-road capable model in the lineup, while a new Sierra 1500 Denali Ultimate is now the top-tier trim of the lineup, which also receives a new premium Bose surround sound audio system with an amplifier, subwoofer, and genuine metal speaker grilles. Top-tier Silverado and Sierra models receive the General Motors Super Cruise semi-autonomous driving system, which allows for hands-free driving on most highways, and all models receive more standard safety equipment.
The new trim level introduced to this series as ZR2 (Chevrolet) which slots in between High Country (Chevrolet) and LTZ (Chevrolet). GMC models receive a similar, though more upscale, model known as AT4X.
The refreshed 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 began shipping to dealerships in the Spring of 2022. Both brands will also sell the outgoing models of both trucks, named the Silverado 1500 LTD and Sierra 1500 Limited respectively, alongside the new models. Only 1500 (half-ton) models of both trucks have been refreshed for 2022, with a refresh of the heavy-duty (2500HD and 3500HD) trucks following at 2024.
Safety
The 2022 Silverado 1500 LTD Crew Cab was tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS):
Silverado EV
In April 2021, GM President Mark Reuss announced Chevrolet would be building an electric variant of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 pickup truck at the Factory ZERO complex in Detroit. The vehicle will have a targeted range of 400 miles. The vehicle was unveiled in January 2022 at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The vehicle has been built from the ground up as a fully electric pickup by using a battery electric platform shared with the GMC Hummer EV, instead of using the existing Silverado platform. Production will start in the Factory ZERO assembly plant (formerly Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly) in the second quarter of 2023.
Medium duty version (4500HD, 5500HD, 6500HD and International CV)
Chevrolet introduced a medium-duty version of its Silverado, the Silverado 4500HD, 5500HD, and 6500HD, which replaced the discontinued Chevrolet Kodiak and GMC TopKick medium-duty trucks. The truck was unveiled at the 2018 Work Truck Show in Indianapolis, Indiana in March 2018, joining the Chevrolet 4500HD/XD and 5500HD/XD cabover trucks. It competes against the Ford Super Duty F-450 and F-550 and Ram 4500 and 5500. Chevrolet also plans to make the vehicles available for sale at least 160 selected dealerships, including the 240 that specialize in fleet and commercial truck sales.
GMC does not offer an equivalent, citing a lack of support for GMC to expand back into a medium duty market while making a push towards a premium market with their current lineup. The move leaves Chevrolet as the only brand in the GM truck division to have medium-duty vehicles in this segment.
All 4500HD, 5500HD, and 6500HD Silverados come standard with Allison 1000 Series and 2000 Series fully automatic transmissions. The truck is powered by a 350 horsepower (260 kW) variant of the Duramax 6.6L V8 diesel.
The medium-duty Silverado is a joint venture between GM and Navistar International. It is built at Navistar's Springfield, Ohio plant. Navistar has also introduced their own version, the International CV. The International CV is the first pickup marketed by International since the 1970s, when their venerable D series of pickups and medium-duty trucks was discontinued.
Military applications
LSSV
When production of the CUCV II ended in 2000, GM redesigned it to coincide with civilian truck offerings. The CUCV nomenclature was changed to Light Service Support Vehicle (LSSV) in 2001.  In 2005, LSSV production switched to AM General, a unit of MacAndrews and Forbes Holdings. The LSSV is a GM-built Chevrolet Silverado 1500, Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD, Chevrolet Tahoe, or Chevrolet Suburban that is powered by a Duramax 6.6 liter turbo diesel engine. The various Silverados, Tahoes, and Suburbans that are used provide numerous platforms for different kinds of vehicles. As GM has redesigned its civilian trucks and SUVs from 2001–present, LSSVs have also been updated cosmetically.
The Militarization of standard GM trucks/SUVs to become LSSVs includes exterior changes such as CARC paint (Forest Green, Desert Sand, or 3-color Camouflage), blackout lights, military bumpers, a brush guard, a NATO slave receptacle/NATO trailer receptacle, a pintle hook and tow shackles. The electrical system is changed to the 24/12-volt military standard. The dashboard has additional controls and data plates. The truck also can be equipped with weapon supports in the cab, cargo tie down hooks, folding troop seats, pioneer tools, winches, and other military accessories.
The Enhanced Mobility Package (EMP) option adds enhanced suspension, 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, a locking differential, on/off-road beadlock tires, a tire pressure monitoring system and other upgrades. About 2,000 LSSV units were sold to U.S. and international military and law enforcement organizations.
