The track "Shameless" is a cover version of a Billy Joel song recorded on his 1989 album Storm Front.
According to the music review website Allmusic, Ropin' the Wind was the first country album to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.
Background
Brooks commented on the album saying:
"Ropin' the Wind was what we called the son of Fences. Ropin' the Wind was made in this kind of tour that we were on from No Fences. We were gone, pretty much 250 days out of the year. And in that remaining 100 days, I elected to cut Ropin' The Wind, and try to write for it. This album became a lot bigger than I ever thought it could possibly be. And when I listen to the singles off of it like 'Rodeo', 'What She's Doing Now', 'The River', 'Papa Loved Mama', and 'Shameless', I look at it and stand very proud. And then when I also look at the cuts, 'Against The Grain', 'Cold Shoulder', these songs I am equally proud of."
