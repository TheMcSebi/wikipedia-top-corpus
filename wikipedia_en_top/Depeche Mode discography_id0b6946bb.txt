Depeche Mode discography
The discography of English electronic music band Depeche Mode consists of 14 studio albums, six live albums, ten compilation albums, 16 box sets, 13 video albums, 55 singles, and 70 music videos. The band's music has been released on several labels, including Some Bizzare, Mute Records, Sire Records, Reprise Records, and Columbia Records. Formed in Basildon, Essex, England in 1980, the group's original line-up was Dave Gahan (lead vocals), Martin Gore (keyboards, guitar, vocals, chief songwriter after 1981), Andy Fletcher (keyboards, bass guitar) and Vince Clarke (keyboards, chief songwriter 1980â€“81). Vince Clarke left the band after the release of their 1981 debut album Speak & Spell and was replaced by Alan Wilder (production, keyboards, drums), who was a band member from 1982 to 1995. Following Wilder's departure, Gahan, Gore, and Fletcher continued as a trio until Fletcher's death in 2022.


Since their debut in 1981, Depeche Mode have had 54 songs in the UK Singles Chart, as well as one US, and two UK number one albums (Songs of Faith and Devotion and Ultra). All studio albums have reached Top 10 in the UK. Also they had 7 number one albums in the German Album Charts from 1993 to 2017.

"Suffer Well", the third single off the album Playing the Angel, was nominated in the category for "Best Dance Recording" at the 49th Grammy Awards in 2007. On 19 December 2006, Depeche Mode's back catalogue was released on the iTunes Store as The Complete Depeche Mode. On 3 December 2009, Sounds of the Universe was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album. They received a second nomination for the video "Wrong": for Best Short Form Music Video at the 52nd Grammy Awards.
Chronology
Starting with their sixth single ("Leave in Silence"), most official European Depeche Mode single releases are chronologically ordered with a sequential number prefixed by the word "BONG". For example, the fifth Depeche Mode single to follow this pattern, "People Are People", is identified with the code "BONG5", printed on the single's cover, spine and on the record or CD itself. The "BONG" designation is preceded with numbers or letters that indicate the format of the release, such as "7" for a 7" single, "CD" for a CD-single, or "i" for an iTunes-only release. Additional letters such as "L" or "XL" denote a limited edition release. Promotional-only releases include a "P" prefix. For example, "PL12BONG37" indicates the limited, promotional-only 12" single release of "Suffer Well". This scheme was modified for one release: "Little 15" was labeled as "12 LITTLE 15" instead of being given a "BONG" designation. Some singles also had unique prefixes, such as the gatefold 7" single of "Personal Jesus", which was designated GBONG17.
The first five Depeche Mode singles did not use "BONG" and instead followed their label's "MUTE" single numbering scheme. Depeche Mode used the BONG numbering scheme until their departure from Mute Records after 2011.
Non-UK single releases (such as the US-only "Strangelove '88"), which were not given BONG designations, are omitted from the following list.
BONG releases with no "L" editions: BONG 1, BONG 7, BONG 9 (and LITTLE 15).
Five "XL" editions: BONG 18, BONG 24, BONG 29, BONG 34 and BONG 37.
Other letters: 7BONG7E, D12BONG9, GBONG17.
