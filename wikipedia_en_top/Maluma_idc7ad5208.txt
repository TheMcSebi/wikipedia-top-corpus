If you listen to my last album [Pretty Boy, Dirty Boy] there are ballads, mambo, merengue and reggaeton and underground stuff. I like to show the versatility that I have to perform."
He has cited Héctor Lavoe, Justin Timberlake and Michael Jackson as his main musical influences. While talking about them, Maluma said: "Justin Timberlake has been a great reference for modern music.

He is my great musical inspiration." He considers the folkloric elements Shakira incorporated into her music an important influence on his career. He has also stated that Ricky Martin "is one of the artists I wanted to be growing up, He's my idol in the industry".
