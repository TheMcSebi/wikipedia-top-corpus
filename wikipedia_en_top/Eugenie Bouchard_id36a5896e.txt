Eugenie Bouchard
Eugenie "Genie" Bouchard (/buːˈʃɑːrd/; French: Eugénie Bouchard, pronounced [øʒeni buʃaʁ]; born February 25, 1994) is a Canadian tennis player. At the 2014 Wimbledon Championships, she became the first Canadian-born player representing Canada to reach the final of a Grand Slam tournament in singles, finishing runner-up to Petra Kvitová. Bouchard also reached the semifinals of the 2014 Australian Open and 2014 French Open. Having won the 2012 Wimbledon girls' title, she was named WTA Newcomer of the Year at the end of the 2013 WTA Tour. Finally, Bouchard received the WTA Most Improved Player award for the 2014 season and reached a career-high ranking of No. 5, becoming the first Canadian tennis player to be ranked in the top 5 in singles format.
Early life and junior career
Eugenie Bouchard was born as one of twins to Michel Bouchard, an investment banker, and Julie Leclair in Montreal.
Bouchard started playing tennis at the age of five and was a member of Tennis Canada's National Training Centre in Montreal. She grew up in Westmount, where she attended elementary school at The Study, a private girls’ school, and lived on the same street as former prime minister Brian Mulroney. At age 12, she moved to Florida with her family. The four children attended a private school in Fort Lauderdale. Eugenie was  coached by Nick Saviano, where she met one of her best childhood friends, tennis player Laura Robson. From that time on, she was nicknamed "the chosen one" by her siblings. At 15, Bouchard returned to Montreal for training.
Her father established a limited partnership called "Tennis Mania" to support Eugenie's career. He and two investors contributed money to the partnership in exchange for ten percent of Bouchard's future earnings when she would become a professional tennis player. In August 2013, a court ruled that the partnership has no legal claims as Eugenie, then a nine-year-old, could not have reasonably agreed to giving away parts of her future earnings. Her father had argued that the money he had put into the partnership before Eugenie turned pro was a business loss which would have meant a tax benefit for himself.
Professional career
2005–10: First events on the ITF Circuit
In 2005, Bouchard participated at the tournament Open Super 12 in Auray, France. She captured the ITF singles and doubles titles in Costa Rica and also the All Canadian ITF singles title in Burlington, Ontario in 2008. In 2009 and at only 15, she won the Canadian Under-18 Indoor Championship in Toronto. At this event, Bouchard overpowered fellow Quebecer Marianne Jodoin to become, at 15 years and a month, one of the youngest winners of the indoor event. Later that year, she won her first professional main-draw match at Caserta, Italy, defeating No. 798 Frederica Grazioso. Also in that year, she won the Pan American Closed ITF Championships.

She played her first tournament since Wimbledon at the Rogers Cup in her hometown of Montreal. Seeded fifth, she received a first-round bye and faced Shelby Rogers in her opener. Bouchard suffered a shocking three-set loss. Bouchard was the seventh seed at the Cincinnati Open and lost again in three sets in the second round, this time to Svetlana Kuznetsova. At the US Open, she was defeated by Ekaterina Makarova in the fourth round. Bouchard received a main-draw wildcard (after forgetting to enter) to participate in the Hong Kong Open, but pulled out of the tournament due to heat stroke suffered at the US Open. She had been the image of promotion for the tournament and promoted widely. Her last-minute withdrawal sparked criticism, as she had allegedly agreed to appearance fees and signed contracts, to which the WTA responded by fining the tournament official. At the inaugural Wuhan Open, Bouchard reached her first WTA Premier-5 final with wins over Mona Barthel, Alison Riske, Alizé Cornet and No. 7, Caroline Wozniacki.

2015: Out of form, concussion at US Open
Bouchard started her season at the Hopman Cup, representing Canada alongside Vasek Pospisil. She lost her first match against the Czech Republic's Lucie Šafářová, and Canada went on to lose the tie. Then, in the tie against the U.S. team, Bouchard beat Serena Williams, while Pospisil beat John Isner to give Canada the win. They defeated Italy in the last tie, but despite the win, they finished second in the group and were eliminated. At the Australian Open, Bouchard lost in the quarterfinals to Maria Sharapova in straight sets. On 5 February 2015, Bouchard began working with Sam Sumyk, who had previously coached Victoria Azarenka to Grand Slam success.
Bouchard, the top seed at Diamond Games at Antwerp, was eliminated in the second round by Mona Barthel after a first-round bye. At Indian Wells, Bouchard was eliminated in the fourth round by qualifier Lesia Tsurenko. A week later in Miami, after a first-round bye, Bouchard was defeated in the second round by yet another qualifier, Tatjana Maria in straight sets.
Bouchard began her clay-court season at the Family Circle Cup. After receiving a bye in the first round, she lost in the second round to unseeded Lauren Davis in straight sets. Bouchard then participated in Fed Cup, representing team Canada. She went on to lose both of her singles matches to Romanians Alexandra Dulgheru and Andreea Mitu. Canada was hence relegated to the World Group II division.
Bouchard lost her first-round match against Barbora Strýcová at the Madrid Open, after winning the first set and up with a break in the second, which put her losing streak at the time at six matches. The next week at the Italian Open, she won her first match since March defeating Zarina Diyas in the second round, but lost in the next round to eventual finalist Carla Suárez Navarro. At the French Open, Bouchard was eliminated in the first round, losing to Kristina Mladenovic.
Her losing streak continued when she lost in the first round to Yaroslava Shvedova at the Rosmalen Open as a wildcard entry and top seed, then in the second round of the Birmingham Classic yet again to Mladenovic after getting bagelled in the third set, having received a first-round bye. Bouchard won her first match on grass defeating Alison Riske in the second round in Eastbourne. However, she was forced to retire against eventual champion, Belinda Bencic, in round three with an abdominal injury. Bouchard next headed to Wimbledon as the defending finalist and the 12th seed. She was taken down in straight sets by qualifier Duan Yingying in the opening round, her second consecutive first-round loss at a Grand Slam event. This loss would push her down to No. 26, her first time out of the top 20 since her semifinal appearance at the 2014 Australian Open. After just six months, Sumyk was fired by Bouchard as coach.
At the Rogers Cup in August, her first tournament in more than a month and her home event, Bouchard was again defeated by eventual champion, Belinda Bencic, in the first round. Ana Ivanovic said about that: "I went through that and it's not easy," "And every person or player goes through it differently because of their character. And (Bouchard) is very young. I think it's important to go back to her basics and what works for her and to work hard and actually listen to herself. (Do) what she needs to do rather than being too much influenced by outside people. "Surround herself with the right people and then stick with it". At the Western & Southern Open the next week, she progressed to the second round over Kateryna Bondarenko in two tie-breaks, her first match win since June, but was immediately eliminated by eventual semifinalist Elina Svitolina. In New Haven, Bouchard was defeated easily in the first round by Roberta Vinci.
At the US Open, Bouchard defeated Alison Riske and Polona Hercog in the first and second round, respectively, which became her first back-to-back wins since March at the Indian Wells Open. In the third round, Bouchard defeated Dominika Cibulková in three-sets to reach the second week at the US Open for the second straight year. The tournament was seen as Bouchard's return to form, as she was also advancing in the doubles and mixed doubles. Bouchard was scheduled to play Roberta Vinci in the fourth round, but was forced to withdraw due to a concussion, an injury she suffered after slipping and falling in the locker-room. A subsequent lawsuit was filed against the United States Tennis Association (USTA) on her behalf, with the parties reaching settlement in 2018. The injury forced Bouchard to withdraw from other tournaments and she played only one match in the remainder of 2015, against Andrea Petkovic at the China Open, a match she had to retire from in the second set after suffering from dizziness. Bouchard ended 2015 as world No. 48 in the WTA rankings.

She was defeated by Tímea Babos in the quarterfinals. The following week at the Hobart International, she had her most decisive victory in almost a year, beating Bethanie Mattek-Sands with the loss of just three games, followed by a tough straight-set win over Alison Van Uytvanck to bring her into her second straight quarterfinal of the year. She then defeated Camila Giorgi and Dominika Cibulková to reach her first final since the 2014 Wuhan Open; however, she lost in straight sets to Alizé Cornet.

At the French Open, she advanced to the second round but lost to Bacsinszky again, despite leading 4–1 in the first set. After the match, Bouchard publicly admitted that her struggles on the court the previous year had led to her struggling to eat properly. This sparked rumours that she had developed an eating disorder, which she soon denied.
Grass-court season began for Bouchard with a loss to qualifier Elise Mertens at the Rosmalen Open in which she won just two games. She went on to be eliminated at the second round of the Mallorca Open by Anastasija Sevastova and then reached the third round at Eastbourne, losing again to Radwanska. At Wimbledon, she beat Magdaléna Rybáriková in straight sets, in a match that began on the outside courts but was finished under the closed roof of Centre Court due to an extremely long rain delay. Less than 24 hours later, she was back on Centre Court and won back-to-back matches in a Grand Slam for the first time this year, defeating Johanna Konta in three sets. In the third round, she lost in straight sets to Dominika Cibulkova.
At her home tournament, the Rogers Cup, Bouchard advanced to the third round with wins over Lucie Šafářová and world No. 10, Dominika Cibulková. Her run was stopped by qualifier Kristína Kučová.

2017: Continued struggles with form
Bouchard started the year by playing at the Brisbane International. She was defeated in the first round by Shelby Rogers. At the Sydney International, Bouchard defeated world No. 23, Zhang Shuai, in the first round. She then defeated world No. 6, Dominika Cibulková, in straight sets, to set up a quarterfinal meeting with world No. 27, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, whom she defeated to reach her first semifinal since February 2016. She lost to world No. 10, Johanna Konta. At the Australian Open, Bouchard defeated Louisa Chirico and Peng Shuai in her first two matches, but lost to CoCo Vandeweghe in three sets in the third round. She lost in the first round of her next four tournaments, the Mexican Open, Indian Wells Masters, Miami Open and Monterrey Open respectively.
Bouchard made a return to the ITF Circuit for the first time in nearly four years at the $80k event in Indian Harbour Beach, but was defeated by Victoria Duval in the quarterfinals. Two weeks later, she lost in the opening round of the İstanbul Cup to Jana Čepelová. In May at the Premier Mandatory Madrid Open, she won her first tour-level match since the Australian Open in January with a victory over Alizé Cornet. She then managed to defeat Maria Sharapova in the second round, her first win in five meetings, to set up a match with world No. 2, Angelique Kerber, in the third round.

In December, it was announced that trial for Bouchard's lawsuit against the USTA (regarding the alleged head injury caused to Bouchard by the slippery surface in a physiotherapy room at the 2015 US Open) would take place in late February 2018, and was expected to last around ten days. Bouchard finished the 2017 season as world number 81, continuing her slide down the WTA rankings.
2018: Out of top 100, late resurgence
After parting company with coach Thomas Högstedt towards the end of 2017, Bouchard began working with Harold Solomon. She teamed up with Vasek Pospisil to compete at the Hopman Cup for Canada, but failed to win a single match in the competition, losing all three of her singles games in straight sets, and picking up a buttock injury during her last match against Elise Mertens. Bouchard's losing streak continued at the Hobart International when she was beaten again in straight sets by Aryna Sabalenka, a result that meant Bouchard fell out of the WTA top 100 for the first time since 2013.
At the Australian Open, she defeated Océane Dodin in the opening round before losing to world No. 1, Simona Halep, in the second. Following several poor results at the front-end of the season, including failure to qualify at the French Open, Bouchard's world ranking plummeted to 194 in early June, her lowest ranking in six years. She slowly improved her ranking over the coming months, starting with qualifying into main draw of Wimbledon, where she lost in the second round to Ashleigh Barty. Bouchard followed this up with a semifinal appearance at the Ladies Championship Gstaad to bring her ranking back to No. 123 in the world.
At the US Open, she showed glimpses of the player she once was, dropping just seven games in three qualifying matches in front of packed crowds. In the main draw, she continued her dominance from qualifying, dispatching French wildcard Harmony Tan, 6–3, 6–1. Bouchard was then ousted from the tournament in the second round, falling to Markéta Vondroušová in straight sets. This also marked the first time since her 2015 concussion that she won a match at the US Open.
Bouchard again struggled following the US Open, failing to win a main-draw match at her next four tournaments. Her luck turned at the Luxembourg Open, where she almost reached her first WTA final since the 2016 Malaysian Open. Bouchard won through three qualifying matches and then defeated Tímea Babos, Carla Suárez Navarro and Andrea Petkovic to set up a semifinal clash with top seed Julia Görges. Despite serving for the match at 5–3 in the second set, Bouchard ultimately lost 7–6, 5–7, 1–6. The result, however, moved her inside the top 100 and saw her end 2018 as world No. 87.
2019: Maiden doubles title, losing streak and rankings decline
Bouchard began the season at the Auckland Open in New Zealand, where she made the quarterfinals before losing to top seed Julia Görges. Bouchard also played doubles at the event, partnering American Sofia Kenin. The pair would go on to win the tournament, earning Bouchard her first doubles title on the WTA Tour.
At the Australian Open, Bouchard made short work of Peng Shuai in the opening round before falling to Serena Williams in the second round. With an early exit at the Australian Open, she opted to compete on the WTA Challenger Tour at the Newport Beach Challenger. Seeded third, she progressed to the quarterfinals, where she was defeated by compatriot and eventual champion Bianca Andreescu.
In February, Bouchard was awarded a wildcard into the Premier 5 tournament in Dubai. She defeated Vera Lapko in the first round before losing to third seed Simona Halep in the second round. The loss to Halep would begin a huge losing streak for Bouchard and some of the worst form since her initial slump in 2015. Bouchard failed to win a match at Indian Wells, Miami, French Open, Eastbourne, Wimbledon, Lausanne, Washington, Rogers Cup, Vancouver and the Bronx to extend her losing streak to 11 matches across WTA main tour, qualifying and ITF Circuit matches. At the US Open, Bouchard's losing streak extended to 12 matches with a straight sets defeat to 12th seed Anastasija Sevastova. Bouchard's ranking fell outside the world's top 150 following her loss at the US Open.
She returned in late September at the Central Coast Open on the ITF Circuit. Seeded third, Bouchard crashed out of the tournament in the opening round to world No. 272, Gabriela Talaba, a little known Romanian player with zero top-200 wins prior to the tournament. The loss extended her losing streak to 13 matches. Following her continued poor results, Bouchard's ranking slumped to 224 in the world. Bouchard returned to the singles circuit at the 125k Houston Challenger. At the event, Bouchard ended her 13-match losing streak and won her first match at any level in nine months, defeating Valentini Grammatikopoulou, in straight sets. She also won through her second-round match against eighth seed Francesca Di Lorenzo. Di Lorenzo retired a break down in the second set, but exited the tournament after retiring three games into her third-round match against Mandy Minella following a foot injury.
Bouchard ended the 2019 season ranked 262.
2020: Resurgence; first WTA final in four years; best Grand Slam showing in three years
At the Auckland Open, for which she was granted a wildcard, Bouchard showed some signs of a return to form. She defeated Kirsten Flipkens and eighth seed Caroline Garcia in straight sets before losing a hard-fought match to Amanda Anisimova in the quarterfinals. Bouchard entered the Australian Open qualifying unseeded, where she won her first two matches against You Xiaodi and Maddison Inglis before slumping to a disappointing straight sets loss in the final qualifying round against Martina Trevisan. After the hiatus from tennis due to the COVID-19 pandemic, she returned to tennis at the Prague Open where she showed more signs of a return to form by upsetting eighth seed Veronika Kudermetova in the first round. She then defeated Tamara Zidanšek in three sets to make her second WTA quarterfinal of 2020. However, she was defeated in three sets by the eventual runner-up and third seed, Elise Mertens.
At the İstanbul Cup, she qualified into the top half, eventually upsetting top seed Svetlana Kuznetsova, and getting her way to the final, to then play Patricia Maria Țig to whom she lost.
At the delayed 2020 French Open, Bouchard made it to the third round before losing to eventual champion Iga Świątek, her best major showing since making it to the third round at the 2017 Australian Open.

By May, she had dropped out of the rankings completely.
In June, Bouchard announced her comeback to the tour at the Wimbledon Championships for the first time since 2021 Monterrey Open.

World TeamTennis
Bouchard has played four seasons with World TeamTennis starting in 2009 when she debuted in the league with the Kansas City Explorers, followed by a season with the Texas Wild in 2013, the New York Empire in 2017, and the Orange County Breakers in 2019. It was announced that she will be joining the Chicago Smash for their debut season, during the 2020 WTT season set to begin July 12 at The Greenbrier.
Bouchard was dominant for the Smash in women's doubles with Bethanie Mattek-Sands during the 2020 season, finishing the season with an 11–5 record, helping the Smash to earn a No. 2 seed in WTT Play-offs. The Smash defeated the Orlando Storm in the semifinals before falling to the New York Empire in a super-tiebreaker for the championship.
Playing style
Bouchard employs a high-risk, aggressive playing style, focused on her powerful groundstrokes, that is played from the baseline. During her 2014 breakout season, Bouchard was noted for her ability to hit the ball hard, flat, and early on the rise, allowing her to defeat multiple top 10 players and run deep into Grand Slams. Her two-handed backhand is her strongest groundstoke, and can penetrate deep into the court, allowing her to push her opponents behind the baseline. Her forehand is notable for its condensed swing, allowing her to generate considerable power, and is especially effective when utilised to redirect power down the line. However, the condensed forehand swing also reduces the level of control Bouchard has over her forehand, which can result in the accumulation of unforced errors when employing this shot. Her first serve is powerful, averaging 103 mph (165 km/h), and having been recorded as high as 111 mph (178 km/h), allowing her to serve aces. Her second serve typically averages 84 mph (135 km/h). Due to her aggressive playing style, she rarely incorporates drop shots, lobs, or sliced backhands into points. Due to her doubles experience, Bouchard is able to volley efficiently, although she rarely approaches the net when she plays singles matches. She has been noted for her fighting attitude and determination.
Endorsements, sponsors and equipment
Following her breakout grand slam final appearance at the 2014 Wimbledon Championships, Bouchard signed a three-year endorsement deal with Coca-Cola, following earlier agreements with Rogers Communications and equipment sponsors Nike and Babolat. The following summer in June 2015, Bouchard signed a multi-year partnership with Aviva Canada. Bouchard has used numerous racquets throughout the years - as a junior, Bouchard used various iterations of the Wilson Blade. As a professional player, she typically used the Babolat Pure Aero, doing so between 2013 and 2018, switching briefly to the Babolat Pure Drive in 2017; she also used the Head Graphene Radical between 2017 and 2018. After her contract with Babolat expired in 2018, Bouchard briefly used the Wilson Ultra 100. Bouchard currently uses Yonex racquets, having endorsed the Yonex VCORE 100 racquet since late 2018. Bouchard's contract with Nike for clothing and footwear expired in 2020, and was not renewed; for the 2021 season, Bouchard is endorsed by New Balance.
Bouchard was ranked No. 1 by SportsPro in their "World's 50 Most Marketable Athletes 2015 list", toppling the likes of Neymar, Steph Curry and Usain Bolt.
