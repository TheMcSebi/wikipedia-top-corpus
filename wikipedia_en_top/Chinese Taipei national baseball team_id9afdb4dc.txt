Name controversy
In 1954, when the team first participated in the Asian Baseball Championship, it competed under the name of United Team of Taiwan. Since the expulsion of the Republic of China from the United Nations in 1971, the National Baseball Team of the Republic of China was forced to compete internationally under the name of Chinese Taipei because of the People's Republic of China's diplomatic pressure through the One China Policy. In Taiwan it is both referred to as 中華隊 (hanyu pinyin: Zhōnghuá Duì; literally, Chinese team) or 台灣隊 (hanyu pinyin: Táiwān Duì; literally, team Taiwan ).
