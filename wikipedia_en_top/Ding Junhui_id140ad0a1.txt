Ding Junhui
Ding Junhui (Chinese: 丁俊晖; born 1 April 1987) is a Chinese professional snooker player. He is the most successful Asian player in the history of the sport. Throughout his career, he has won 14 major ranking titles, including three UK Championships (2005, 2009, 2019). He has twice reached the final of the Masters, winning once in 2011. In 2016, he became the first Asian player to reach the final of the World Championship.


Ding began playing snooker at age nine and rose to international prominence in 2002 after winning the Asian Under-21 Championship and the Asian Championship. At age 15, he became the youngest winner of the IBSF World Under-21 Championship. In 2003, Ding turned professional at the age of 16. His first major professional successes came in 2005 when he won the China Open and the UK Championship, becoming the first player from outside Great Britain and Ireland to win the title.
During his career, he has compiled more than 600 century breaks, including six maximum breaks, in professional play. He is the only Asian player to be ranked world number one, which he first achieved in 2014 to become the 11th player to reach the top spot. He is a long-time resident of Sheffield, England, and owns the Ding Junhui Snooker Academy in the same city.
Early life
Ding Junhui was born on 1 April 1987 in Yixing, Jiangsu. At eight years old, Ding tagged along with his father, a pool enthusiast who wanted to practice with a local pool expert. When his father went for a toilet break, Ding took the cue and played with the professional. Ding won the game before his father returned. Since then, Ding's parents supported him in cue sports training, particularly snooker. At age nine, he was taken by his father to the training center of the Chinese national snooker team near Shanghai and persuaded his mother to sell their home and grocery business so Ding could continue playing snooker as a career. The family moved to Dongguan, Guangdong, and Ding left formal education at age 11 to practice snooker for eight hours each day.
Career
Early career
Ding rose to international prominence in 2002 at age 15, when he won the Asian Under-21 Championship, the Asian Championship, and became the youngest ever winner of the IBSF World Under-21 Championship. He was unable to progress much in 2003 when both Asian tournaments were canceled because of the 2002–03 SARS virus outbreak, but he reached the semi-finals of the IBSF World Under-21 Championship, and the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) awarded him a concession to play on the main snooker tour, which enabled him to turn professional in September 2003. In the same year, Ding became the number-one-ranked player in China.
First UK Championship and reaching the top-16 (2004–2007)
In February 2004, Ding was awarded a wildcard entry to the Masters held in London. In the wildcard round, he beat the world number 16 player Joe Perry. In the first round, he lost 5–6 to Stephen Lee after leading 5–2. In April 2005, Ding celebrated his 18th birthday by reaching the final of the China Open in Beijing, defeating world top 16 ranked players Peter Ebdon, Marco Fu, and Ken Doherty. In the final, Ding beat the world number three Stephen Hendry by 9–5 to win his first ranking tournament. The match was watched by 110 million people on China's national sports channel CCTV-5; it was the largest television audience recorded for a snooker match. In December 2005, Ding beat Jimmy White, Paul Hunter, and Joe Perry to reach the final of the UK Championship. In the final, he beat Steve Davis by 10–6 to become the first player from outside the UK to win the tournament. Ding's provisional world ranking rose from 62 at the start of the 2005–06 season to 27 at the end of the season.
At the 2006 China Open, Ding lost 6–2 in the semi-finals to eventual winner Mark Williams. During the Northern Ireland Trophy event, he beat Stephen Lee 6–1 in the semi-finals. In the final, Ding defeated Ronnie O'Sullivan 9–6 to win his third ranking tournament, becoming the third person under 20 to do so after O'Sullivan and John Higgins. In December 2006, Ding won three gold medals at the 2006 Asian Games, winning the single, double, and team snooker competitions. The following week, he reached the quarter-finals of the 2006 UK Championship as the defending champion, but lost 9–5 to his practice partner and eventual winner Peter Ebdon. Ding ended the 2006–07 season ranked world number nine, which was his first top-ten placement.
Youngest maximum break and wildcard Masters finalist (2007–2009)
In January 2007, Ding defeated Cao Xinlong 5–4 to reach the final of the Chinese National Championship in his home town Yixing, Jiangsu. He defeated Xiao Guodong in the final by 6–2 to become the national champion again. On 14 January, Ding made a 147 break in his first-round match against Anthony Hamilton at the Masters, which was Ding's first maximum break and the first maximum break made at the competition since Kirk Stevens' in 1984. The break made Ding the youngest player to make a televised 147—a record previously held by Ronnie O'Sullivan—and the first Chinese player to make a televised maximum. Ding played O'Sullivan in the final, becoming the second-youngest player and the first Asian player to reach a Masters' final.
After Ding won the first two frames, O'Sullivan went on to dominate the match. This, along with the boisterous and hostile nature of the London crowd, led Ding to leave the table in tears during the twelfth frame when he was trailing 8–3 in the best-of-19-frames contest. Ding appeared resigned to defeat, taking little time to consider his shot selection, and shook hands with O'Sullivan after the frame. O'Sullivan consoled Ding and they walked arm-in-arm to the backstage area. Because it was the last frame before the mid-session interval, it was uncertain whether Ding had conceded the match. O'Sullivan won the match in the first frame after the interval; Ding later said he thought the match was a "best of 17".
Ding was defeated in the first round of the next two consecutive tournaments, losing 5–2 to Stephen Maguire in the 2007 Malta Cup and 5–1 to Jamie Cope in the Welsh Open. In March 2007, Ding qualified for the televised stages of the World Championship for the first time after beating Mark Davis in the final qualifying round. His losing streak in ranking tournaments continued, with a 5–3 loss to Barry Hawkins in the first round of the China Open and a 10–2 loss against O'Sullivan at the World Championship. Despite this, Ding ended the 2006–07 season ranked world number 11.
The following season, Ding was consistent, reaching the last 16 of all-but-one ranking event. However, he failed to reach a single semi-final, causing him to drop to number 13 in the world rankings. At the 2008 World Snooker Championship, Ding reached the second round for the first time, beating Marco Fu 10–9 before losing 13–7 to Stephen Hendry. During the 2007 Premier League Snooker, Ding recorded 495 unanswered points (most points without reply) against Stephen Hendry, setting a record for the most unanswered points in any professional snooker tournament. The record was surpassed in 2014 when Ronnie O'Sullivan recorded 556 unanswered points against Ricky Walden.
Ding started the 2008–09 season on a high, winning the Jiangsu Classic after beating Ryan Day 4–0 in the semi-final and Mark Selby 6–5 in the final. In October, he participated in the third event of the World Series of Snooker. Ding won the event after defeating Ken Doherty 6–4 in the final. In the fourth event in November, Ding defeated Mark Selby 4–2 in the semi-final, before losing to John Higgins 5–0 in the final. On 16 December, in his second-round match against John Higgins at the 2008 UK Championship, Ding scored a maximum 147 break in the third frame.

Ding won the match 13–10 to set up a semi-final against Judd Trump. In their semi-final, Ding and Trump were level at 12–12 after the third session. In the last session, Trump built momentum and led 14–12 but Ding won the next three frames with a 138 break to tie Mark King for highest tournament break and a 119 break. Ding lost the next three frames and lost the match 15–17. He ended the season with career-high ranking of world number four.

Players Tour Championship (2012/2013)
Ding did not progress past the second round of the first six ranking events of the 2012–13 season and found himself ranked world number 11 in December. He won the minor-ranking Scottish Open, defeating Anthony McGill in the final.

At the World Open, he was defeated 0–5 by John Higgins in the quarter-finals. His title at the Scottish Open formed part of the Players Tour Championship events; Ding finished sixth on the order of merit to qualify for the finals.

His poor form in tournaments played in China continued; he was beaten 3–5 by Barry Hawkins in the first round of the China Open. Ding beat veteran Alan McManus 10–5 in the first round of the World Championship and recovered from 2–6 after the first session against Mark King in the second round to lead 9–7 after the next session and won 13–9. Ding faced Barry Hawkins in the quarter-finals and played inconsistently throughout the match, losing 7–13. His end-of-season world ranking was 10.
Three consecutive ranking wins (2013/2014)
In the second round of the 2013 Wuxi Classic, Ding lost 5–1 to Joe Perry. At the minor-ranking Bluebell Wood Open, he made a rare 146 break while beating Jimmy Robertson in the quarter-finals before losing 4–3 to Marco Fu in the semi-finals.

He then played at the Ruhr Open, a minor-ranking event, losing to Mark Allen 4–1 in the final.
Following that, Ding played in the first Indian Open, defeating Aditya Mehta 5–0 in the final to become the first player to win back-to-back major-ranking event titles in the same season since Ronnie O'Sullivan in 2003. Ding continued dominating the game in the following major ranking event, the International Championship, where he beat Graeme Dott 9–7 in the semi-finals with a 63-point clearance in the last frame. In the final—the second all-Chinese ranking event final in three ranking events—Ding and Marco Fu compiled seven century breaks; Ding five and Fu two. Ding rallied from 9–8 down to win the final two frames and become the first player to win three consecutive major-ranking events since Stephen Hendry won five consecutively in 1990.
After his hat-trick, Ding reached world number three in the rankings for the first time in his career, before reaching number two just behind Neil Robertson. Ding won two more ranking titles; the German Masters, beating Judd Trump 9–5 in the final, and the China Open by beating Robertson 10–5 in the final to equal Hendry's season record of five wins. He was also the runner-up in the Welsh Open to Ronnie O'Sullivan. At the World Championship, however, Ding was defeated by world number 75 Michael Wasley 10–9 in the first round, which Ding had led 6–3 and 9–8. Ding finished the season ranked world number two—a career high—and was held off the number-one spot by Mark Selby, who won the World Championship. Ding was fined £5,000 and referred to the WPBSA Disciplinary Committee by the WSL for failing to attend their awards dinner.
2014/2015
At the start of the 2014–15 season, Ding failed to qualify for the televised stages of the 2014 Wuxi Classic, losing 5–0 to Oliver Brown in the qualifiers. Ding, however, then won the Yixing Open with a 4–2 victory over Michael Holt in the final. At the Shanghai Masters, he was defeated 6–4 by Stuart Bingham in the semi-finals after losing the last four frames of the match. Ronnie O'Sullivan eliminated Ding 6–4 in the semi-finals of the Champion of Champions.
In the third round of the 2014 UK Championship, Ding fought from 5–1 down to send his match against James Cahill to a deciding frame. Ding recovered from needing three snookers in the tenth frame when world 100-ranked Cahill left a free ball. In the final frame, however, Ding missed a red when on a break of 32, which allowed Cahill a chance to knock him out, which he did. Despite the loss, Ding became the 11th world number one and first from Asia thanks to early eliminations of Mark Selby and Neil Robertson.
Ding held the top spot for a week before Robertson reclaimed it. Ding's poor form continued into 2015 as he was eliminated in the first round in six successive events: 6–3 to Joe Perry at the Masters; 5–4 to Ryan Day at the German Masters; 4–1 to world number 115 Lee Walker at the Welsh Open; 4–3 to Thepchaiya Un-Nooh at the Indian Open; 4–1 to Ricky Walden at the World Grand Prix; and 4–1 to Joe Perry at the 2015 Players Championship Grand Final.

Fall from the top 16 (2021)
Ding's best performances during the 2020–21 season were reaching the quarter-finals of four ranking tournaments as well as the quarter-finals of the Champion of Champions. His season ended with a 9–10 loss to Stuart Bingham in the first round of the 2021 World Snooker Championship. By late 2021, he had won just one ranking event in the previous four years, had missed many tournaments through choice or circumstance, and had struggled to practice while spending long stretches of time in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. After he lost 3–6 to world number 55 Sam Craigie in the last 64 of the 2021 UK Championship, he fell out of the top 16 in the world rankings, meaning that he did not qualify for the Masters for the first time since he was 18 years old in 2006. Speaking on BBC Two after Ding's loss to Craigie, seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry expressed concern about Ding's future in the sport: "I don't know what has happened to Ding. I don't know whether we have seen the best of him. He looks like he doesn't really care that much anymore... Any pressure balls he does not look like getting anymore. I don't know where Ding goes from here." After Ding lost 3–4 to world number 65 Zhang Anda in the qualifying round of the Scottish Open, pundit Alan McManus echoed Hendry's concerns, stating that Ding had "big problems to fix." In January 2022, Ding was ranked 30th in the world, was 68th on the one-year ranking list, and had fallen to become China's fourth-ranked player, behind Zhao Xintong, Yan Bingtao, and Zhou Yuelong.
Ding beat compatriot Tian Pengfei 6–4 and David Lilley 10–7 in the third and final qualifying rounds of the 2022 World Championship but lost 10–8 to Kyren Wilson in the first round, showing signs of frustration during the match. It was Ding's 16th consecutive year at the Crucible.
Before the 2022 UK Championship, Ding had fallen to 38th in the world rankings and had to win two qualifying matches to reach the tournament's main stage. However, Ding reached his first ranking final in three years, with wins including a 6–0 whitewash of world number one O'Sullivan in the quarter-finals. Ding lost 7–10 to Mark Allen in the final, despite having led 6–1. As runner-up, he advanced from 38th to 19th place in the world rankings.
