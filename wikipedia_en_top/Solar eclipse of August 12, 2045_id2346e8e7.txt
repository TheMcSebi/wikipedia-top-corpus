Solar eclipse of August 12, 2045
A total solar eclipse will occur on Saturday, August 12, 2045, when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide.
In this total solar eclipse, the path of totality is not exactly the same as the August 21, 2017 total solar eclipse because the lunar node is descending and the August 2017 solar eclipse is ascending.
It will be the fourth longest eclipse of the 21st century with a magnitude of 1.0774 occurring just one hour after perigee. It will be visible throughout much of the continental United States, with a path of totality running through northern California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. The total eclipse will be greatest over the Bahamas, before continuing over the Turks and Caicos Islands, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Brazil.
The path of totality of this eclipse will be seen over many major cities, including Reno, Salt Lake City, Colorado Springs, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Tampa, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Nassau, Santo Domingo, Belém, São Luís and Recife. It will also be the second total eclipse visible from Little Rock in 21.3 years. Totality will last for at least 6 minutes along the part of the path that starts at Camden, Alabama, crossing Florida and ending near the southernmost Bahama Islands. The longest duration of totality will be 6 minutes 5.5 seconds at 25°54.594′N 78°32.19′W, which is over the Atlantic Ocean east of Fort Lauderdale and south of Freeport, Bahamas.
The solar eclipse of August 21, 2017 had a very similar path of totality over the U.S., about 250 miles (400 km) to the northeast, also crossing the Pacific coast and Atlantic coast of the country. This is because when a solar eclipse crosses the U.S. in mid-August at an ascending node (i.e. moves from south to north during odd numbered saros), the path of the eclipse tracks from coast to coast. When a solar eclipse crosses the U.S. in mid-August at descending node (even numbered saros), the path tracks a large distance southward.

Solar eclipses of 2044–2047
This eclipse is a member of a semester series. An eclipse in a semester series of solar eclipses repeats approximately every 177 days and 4 hours (a semester) at alternating nodes of the Moon's orbit.
Saros 136
Solar Saros 136, repeating every 18 years, 11 days, contains 71 events. The series started with partial solar eclipse on June 14, 1360, and reached a first annular eclipse on September 8, 1504. It was a hybrid event from November 22, 1612, through January 17, 1703, and total eclipses from January 27, 1721, through May 13, 2496. The series ends at member 71 as a partial eclipse on July 30, 2622, with the entire series lasting 1262 years. The longest eclipse occurred on June 20, 1955, with a maximum duration of totality at 7 minutes, 7.74 seconds. All eclipses in this series occurs at the Moon's descending node.
Tritos series
This eclipse is a part of a tritos cycle, repeating at alternating nodes every 135 synodic months (≈ 3986.63 days, or 11 years minus 1 month). Their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month (period of perigee), but groupings of 3 tritos cycles (≈ 33 years minus 3 months) come close (≈ 434.044 anomalistic months), so eclipses are similar in these groupings.
Metonic series
The metonic series repeats eclipses every 19 years (6939.69 days), lasting about 5 cycles. Eclipses occur in nearly the same calendar date. In addition, the octon subseries repeats 1/5 of that or every 3.8 years (1387.94 days). All eclipses in this table occur at the Moon's descending node.
