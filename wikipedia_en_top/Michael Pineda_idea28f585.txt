He made his MLB debut on April 5, giving up three runs in six innings in a loss. Pineda pitched 7+1⁄3 innings, allowed two runs, struck out seven batters, and earned his first MLB win on April 12, 2011.

He was 8–6 at that point, but with a 3.03 ERA and 113 strikeouts in 113 innings, against only 36 walks.

2012–2014
The Mariners traded Pineda to the New York Yankees with José Campos, for Jesús Montero and Héctor Noesí on January 13, 2012. The Yankees needed a top-tier starting pitcher to pair with CC Sabathia, and the Mariners felt they could afford to part with Pineda because of their depth of top-tier pitching prospects, including Danny Hultzen, James Paxton, and Taijuan Walker.
Pineda was placed on the 15-day disabled list with tendinitis in his right shoulder at the culmination of spring training, causing him to miss the start of the 2012 season. During his rehabilitation, he suffered an anterior labral tear in his right shoulder. He underwent arthroscopic surgery on May 1, 2012, and was ruled out for the 2012 season.

In six games pitched for the RailRiders, Pineda had a 1–1 record and a 3.86 ERA.
Pineda competed for a spot in the Yankees' starting rotation during spring training in 2014. He was named the Yankees' fifth starter towards the end of spring training. He made his first start for the Yankees on April 5, 2014. On April 10, during a start against the Boston Red Sox, Boston broadcasters noticed a substance that appeared to be pine tar on the palm of Pineda's pitching hand in the early innings of the game. Midway through Pineda's outing, the substance was wiped from his hand only to be added to his wrist. The umpires of the game were never notified and no action was taken against Pineda, who told reporters after the game that the substance on his hand was dirt. On April 23, 2014, during Pineda's next game against the Red Sox, Red Sox manager John Farrell notified the umpires about pine tar on Pineda's neck, and he was ejected from the game in the second inning.  Pineda was suspended for 10 games for the incident. He had a 1.83 ERA in 19+2⁄3 innings pitched across his first four starts.
While pitching in a simulated game during the suspension, Pineda developed a strain in his teres major muscle, which was expected to require three to four weeks to heal. Following inflammation experienced in late May, Pineda's return was pushed back to August. The Yankees activated Pineda to start on August 13. Pineda finished the season with a 5–5 record and a 1.89 ERA in 76+1⁄3 innings.
2015–2017
Eligible for salary arbitration for the first time, Pineda and the Yankees agreed on a $2.1 million salary for the 2015 season. On May 10, 2015, in a win against the Baltimore Orioles, Pineda struck out a career-high 16 batters over seven innings while also walking none, breaking his previous career-high of 10 strikeouts in a single game. He also became the first pitcher since Johan Santana in 2007 with 16 strikeouts and no walks in a single game. Pineda went on the disabled list on July 30 due to a strained flexor muscle in his right forearm. He finished the season with a 12–10 record and a 4.37 ERA in 160+2⁄3 innings across 27 games started.
In 2016, Pineda and the Yankees again agreed on a contract figure without going to arbitration. Pineda earned $4.3 million. Pineda finished the 2016 season with a 6–12 record and a career-worst 4.82 ERA. He made a career-high 32 starts, pitched a career-high 175+2⁄3 innings and recorded a career-high 207 strikeouts while walking only 53. He led the American League with an average of 10.6 strikeouts per nine innings pitched. However, he also allowed 27 home runs.
Pineda and the Yankees agreed on a $7.4 million salary for the 2017 season, his last before qualifying for free agency.

Pineda began the 2019 season with the Twins. On May 28, Pineda was placed on the 10-day injured list with right knee tendinitis. Pineda pitched to a 11–5 record and a 4.01 ERA, before he received a 60-game suspension without pay for testing positive for hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly prescribed for blood pressure, on September 7. The suspension had been reduced from 80 to 60 games on appeal, because a compelling case was made that it was not used as a masking agent for a performance-enhancing drug. Pineda subsequently released a statement that read, in part: "I mistakenly took a medication that was given to me by a close acquaintance, who obtained it over-the-counter and assured me it would safely help me manage my weight. I ingested a few of these pills without the consent of the Twins' training staff. Testing revealed trace elements of a substance called hydrochlorothiazide, which is a banned diuretic under baseball's testing program."
On December 10, 2019, Pineda re-signed with the Twins on a two-year contract worth $20 million. On September 1, 2020, Pineda returned from his suspension and led the Twins to a 3–2 victory over the Chicago White Sox.
