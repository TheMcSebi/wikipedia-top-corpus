Medal table
The ranking in this table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee.
The ranking sorts by the number of gold medals earned by a country—in this context, an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically.
