Stadler FLIRT
Stadler FLIRT (Fast Light Intercity and Regional Train; German: Flinker Leichter Intercity- und Regional-Triebzug) is a passenger multiple unit trainset made by Stadler Rail of Switzerland. The baseline design of FLIRT is an electric multiple unit articulated trainset that can come in units of two to twelve cars with two to six motorized axles. The maximum speed is 200 km/h (124 mph). Standard floor height is 57 cm (22+7⁄16 in), but 78 cm (30+11⁄16 in) high floors are also available for platform heights of 76 cm (29+15⁄16 in).
The FLIRT train was originally developed for the Swiss Federal Railways and was first delivered in 2004. The trains quickly became a success and were ordered by operators in Algeria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and, most recently (2018), Canada. As of October 2021, more than 2500 units have been sold.
Other than electric (EMU), the FLIRT is produced in diesel-electric version (DEMU), and recently also as electro-diesel (bi-mode/BMU), first ordered by the Aosta Valley region in Italy (BTR.813), and then by Greater Anglia (British Rail Class 755), Norske Tog, and Wales & Borders ("tri-mode" version: diesel/overhead electric/battery).
Specifications
The FLIRT is a new generation of multiple units, even though it has a striking resemblance with GTW vehicles. The trains can have two to six sections and electric variants are available for all commonly used power supply systems (AC and DC) as well as standard and broad gauge. It has Jacobs bogies shared between the individual coaches, with wide walk-through gangways. The floor height at the entrances can be chosen by the operator, providing level boarding at most stations. Automatic couplers of either Schwab type (on all Swiss units) or Scharfenberg type at both ends of the train allow up to four trains to be connected.
All FLIRT variations use IGBT-based traction converters from ABB, which drive the TSA induction motors located in the two bogies at either end of the train. On the two-section trains, only one bogie is powered, while on longer versions it is possible to have a third powered bogie in the middle, found on the trains for Vy in Norway and for PKP Intercity in Poland. Each bogie usually has a continuous power rating of 1,000 kW (1,300 hp) giving a typical four-section train 2,000 kW (2,700 hp) total power output as well as maximum power output of 2,600 kW (3,500 hp) over a short time. Depending on the number of powered bogies, the length and weight, they will reach top speeds between 120 and 200 km/h (75 and 124 mph) (typically 160 km/h or 99 mph). Acceleration also varies between 0.8 and 1.2 m/s2 (2.6 and 3.9 ft/s2).
The diesel version is essentially an electric version with a diesel power module inserted, generating electricity for the electric motors. In TEXRail application, the diesel power module contains two 520 kW (697 hp) Deutz AG TCD 16.0 V8 that complies with US EPA Tier 4 emission standard.
Diesel, bi-mode electro-diesel, hybrid diesel-battery, or battery versions are essentially baseline design with an additional one-third length non-passenger car inserted in the trainset – called a PowerPack car – which contains the electricity generating and storage components, such as diesel engines and batteries, that provide electricity to the train to run "off-wire". It has a gangway through the centre to allow passengers to pass between the two parts of the train.
Operators
Algeria
On 18 March 2006, the Algerian operator SNTF announced that it had ordered 64 four-car EMUs for suburban services in Algiers. The trains were delivered between 2008 and 2010.
Azerbaijan
In November 2019, it was announced that Azərbaycan Dəmir Yolları (Azerbaijan Railways) had placed a €115 million order for ten Russian gauge Stadler FLIRT units in various configurations, for delivery to start taking place in 2022.
The order specification is as follows:
Train length is to range between 93 and 107 m (305 ft 1+3⁄8 in and 351 ft 5⁄8 in), with capacity varying from 236 to 271 passengers.
Because the Azerbaijan Railway is currently converting the electrification voltage of many lines on its network from 3 kV DC to 25 kV AC, the diesel fleet will be introduced first, allowing the service to be upheld during this conversion process.
Belarus
Ten Russian gauge units were delivered to the Belarusian Railways in 2011. Six more were delivered from 2013 to 2014.
The trains are mostly used on various suburban routes around Minsk, such as Minsk-Pasažyrski to Minsk National Airport. The Stadler FLIRT trains are also used as inter-regional transport in Belarus, on the routes Minsk–Homieĺ, and Minsk–Brest.
Two Stadler FLIRT units with an interior optimised for longer distance (EPm-class) were delivered to Belarus in 2015 to 2016, and in January 2019, ten more of these trains were ordered for delivery in 2020.
Canada
On 3 May 2018 it was announced that the city of Ottawa would be purchasing 7 diesel-electric FLIRT trains to use on its upgraded and extended Trillium Line. The trains started tests for service in January 2022.
Czech Republic
The Czech private operator LEO Express ordered 5 units. Units are modified as InterCity trains. All 5 units have operated on the Prague–Ostrava line since December 2012. Since December 2013 one unit is operated on the Prague–Staré Město u Uherského Hradiště and since December 2014 next one unit is operated on the international route Prague–Košice (Slovak Republic). The maximum speed of these units is 189 km/h (117 mph), but in service it is limited to 160 km/h (99 mph).
Estonia
Elron ordered 18 electric (6 4-car and 12 3-car) and 20 diesel (6 4-car, 8 3-car and 6 2-car) broad-gauged trains. By June 2014 all 38 trains were delivered. This has been the first time FLIRT DMUs were produced. First 5 trains went into service on 1 July 2013 and by January 2014 all old trains were replaced by the new ones. On 16 April 2014 one of the new DMUs that had been operating for just 5 months had an accident near Raasiku (truck collision). The unit was badly damaged. It will go back into service by 2015 when the two damaged carriages will be replaced with new ones.
In November 2014, Elron initiated an investigation into suspected flaws in some diesel trains. Two different build flaws were found in many of the trains and faulty components were replaced under warranty.
Finland
81 4-section 1,524 mm (5 ft) broad-gauged FLIRT units, classified as Sm5 in the Finnish system, have been ordered by Pääkaupunkiseudun Junakalusto Oy (a joint venture between the cities of Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen) for service on the Helsinki commuter rail network. The Sm5 units are leased by Pääkaupunkiseudun junakalusto to the Helsinki Regional Transport Authority, but they are currently operated by the VR Group. The initial order in 2006 was for 32 trainsets. 9 further units were ordered in 2011 and 34 further units in 2014.
The first Sm5 unit arrived in Finland on 11 November 2008. Following preliminary testing the first unit was displayed to the public in Helsinki on 17 December 2008. During the remainder of on 2008 and for most of 2009 the Sm5 units were extensively tested in different parts of Finland. The first unit entered passenger service on 18 November 2009.
Germany
The Cantus Verkehrsgesellschaft, a joint subsidiary of Hessische Landesbahn and Hamburger Hochbahn, became the first German FLIRT operator when they received their first train in 2006. Their fleet consists of 14 three-car and 6 four-car units.
Since December 2007 Abellio Rail NRW has operated 9 3-car and 8 2-car FLIRT trains for regional routes between Essen, Hagen, Iserlohn and Siegen. This was the first time that a FLIRT with only two sections was ordered.
Also since December 2007 WestfalenBahn uses 14 3-car and 5 five-car trains for trains services in the Teutoburg Forest region.
In 2006 DB Regio, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn ordered 5 5-section vehicles for regional services on the German east coast. The trains were delivered in August 2007 and, until December 2019, were used on the routes Rostock–Stralsund–Lietzow–Sassnitz (Hanse-Express), Sassnitz–Stralsund and Binz–Lietzow. Since October 2020, they run the RB17 (Wismar – Ludwigslust).
The biggest order from Germany so far came in October 2006 from the leasing company Angel Trains Europa when they ordered 25 4-car FLIRT trains. All 25 units have been leased to Eurobahn who uses them on the Hellweg Network in North Rhine-Westphalia. Only a year later, in November 2007, Angel Trains ordered 4 more four-car and 14 five-car trains that will also be used by Eurobahn. In 2017, Eurobahn also took over the WestfalenBahn operation of the Teutoburger-Wald-Network, taking over 18 FLIRT 1 units, as well as ordering 8 new FLIRT 3 units.
On the InnoTrans 2008, a trade fair focused on rail transport, Vias announced their order for 12 four-section and 7 three-section units. Starting in December 2010, the trains were put on the Frankfurt–Koblenz route. The same year, the Hessische Landesbahn (HLB) started to operate 3 three- and 5 six car FLIRT units on the Frankfurt – Gießen – Siegen line.
Starting in December 2013, the Bayerische Oberlandbahn, called Bayerische Regiobahn (BRB) since 2020, uses 3 three car and 28 six car FLIRTs for their Meridian services, which run between Munich-Salzburg and Kufstein. Since August 2014, the ownership of the trains was transferred to AlphaTrains, only to be leased back for the Meridian.
From December 2014 on, the RE 1 (Koblenz – Trier (– Luxembourg /) – Saarbrücken – Ludwigshafen – Mannheim), RE 2 (Koblenz – Frankfurt), RE 4 (Frankfurt (Main) – Mainz – Ludwigshafen – Karlsruhe), RE 14 (Frankfurt (Main) – Mainz – Ludwigshafen – Mannheim), are operated with FLIRT 3 units, with the RE 1 being coupled with a CFL-operated KISS between Trier and Koblenz.
Go-Ahead Germany ordered 45 units in 2016 for delivery in 2019.
Transdev ordered 64 3-car units in November 2018, planned to enter service in 2021 on Hanover S-Bahn lines. In June 2019, Transdev subsidiary NordWestBahn awarded Stadler a €100m order to supply 16 Flirt electric multiple-units for the Bremen/Niedersachsen S-Bahn services. The trains will enter service starting December 2022.
In July 2019, Schleswig-Holstein rail authority NAH.SH awarded Stadler a €600m order for 55 battery-powered Flirt Akku multiple unit trains along with maintenance for 30 years. The trains, which offer 150 km (93 mi)of battery range, will start entering service in 2022 and replace DMUs on non-electrified routes.

Netherlands
On 23 April 2015 the Netherlands' railway operator Nederlandse Spoorwegen announced that it was ordering 58 Stadler FLIRT EMUs, comprising 25 4-car units and 33 3-car units, to be delivered by the end of 2016. The very short delivery deadline (20 months), to meet capacity needs, allowed NS to invoke 'urgency mode' provisions in EU procurement rules and place the order without tendering. The 58 FLIRT EMUs for NS were produced at Stadler's plant in Siedlce, Poland, 92 km east of Warsaw, following the order which that plant completed for PKP Intercity in Poland. Meanwhile, Arriva Nederland also ordered two- and three-car units for operation in the province of Limburg.
As of 2023, FLIRT 2, 3 and 4 EMUs are in service in the Netherlands with the following operators:
Norway
50 Flirt units were ordered by Vy (formerly Norwegian State Railways (NSB)), with a further 100 on option. 26 units were placed on the Oslo Commuter Rail and the remaining 24 units were used on regional and express routes. During spring and summer 2012 all Flirt trains used by Vy were fitted with free wireless Internet access for the passengers. In the Vy's system, the FLIRT trains are classified as "class 74" for regional trainsets and "class 75" for local trainsets.
All trains have 5 cars. However, in contrast to previous 5-car FLIRTs they will have a third powered bogie giving them a maximum power output of 4,500 kW (6,000 hp) and a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph). Trial runs started on the Bergen Line in 2009, using a SBB-CFF-FFS unit. The first units were scheduled to enter passenger service on 29 February 2012. The FLIRT's introduction was delayed after a unit derailed during tests by NSB on 15 February 2012, injuring five people. The train had much too high speed and there were no safety systems along the railway that could catch the driver's error.
The first train entered into regular service on 2 May 2012 on the line from Skien to Lillehammer. The last of the 50 trains was delivered on 24 January 2014. Vy has ordered a further 57 trains, for a total of 107, as of October 2015. In 2017 an order for additional 18 was placed, current total is 125, with 40 short regional trains, and the rest as the local commuter train. In July 2018, a total of 100 trains have been delivered, 36 short regional and 64 local commuter trains.
Local class 75 trains are configured with 5 seats (2+3) abreast. The class 74 regional trains were also delivered with 2+3 seating on regional trains except in the premium "Komfort" section that had 2+2 seating. Significant passengers complaints over cramped seating led Vy to reconfigure the regional trains into 2+2 seating during 2014.
These fleets have 800 mm (31+1⁄2 in) floor without steps. Since many Norwegian platforms are too low to access to these fleets, they will have to be raised to 550 mm (21+5⁄8 in) platform height to be accessible. These fleets cannot operate for low platform lines (e.g. Bergen Line, Sørlandet Line west of Kongsberg, Dovre Line north of Lillehammer). Raised platforms will be matched with conventional train steps, hence vertical gaps between this fleet and platforms will remain.
In 2018 the last options were used, which includes 25 trainsets, most of which include the Class 75 and 74 that are set to operate on Gjøvikbanen and Vossebanen.
The two last are bi-mode/hybrid trains named Class 76. These are similar to the FLIRT 3's owned by Greater Anglia in the UK will have an extra carriage for diesel generators, in order to operate fully electric on electrified parts of the railway and diesel supported by batteries on tracks without wires.
In total 14 trainsets of the bi-modal type 76 will be delivered to serve the Trønder Commuter Rail as well as the Meråker and Røros Lines. These will replace the aging Class 92's built by Duewag which are fully diesel. All this is included Bane Nor's (Norway's Rail Management Agency) and Jernbaneverkets plan to finally modernize the Trøndelag Railways, which have outdated buildings and infrastructure. These lines are also already partially electrified (between Støren and Trondheim), and are planned to be further electrified in stages.
Poland
Koleje Mazowieckie in 2008 bought 10 4-car 3 kV DC (class ER75) units for services in the Warsaw region.
Koleje Śląskie (KŚ) bought 4 4-car 3 kV DC units (class EN75) for service in Silesia. Łódzka Kolej Aglomeracyjna (ŁKA) in 2012 ordered 20 2-car FLIRT3 units for service in the region around Łódź, for delivery by February 2015. 
PKP Intercity in August 2013 ordered 20 8-car 3 kV DC FLIRT3 units (class ED160) with interiors for long-distance travel and top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph), for service on four long-distance routes in Poland, from a consortium of Stadler Polska and Newag for delivery by October 2015. In 2018 Koleje Mazowieckie started another order of total 61 5-car 3 kV DC FLIRT3 units (class ER160) in 5 batches slated for deliveries from 2020 to 2022.
Portugal
In October 2020, Comboios de Portugal have ordered a delivery of 22 FLIRT units in 1,668 mm (5 ft 5+21⁄32 in) for the renewal of its regional fleet, these are the first FLIRT trains in the Iberian Peninsula. The order of 22 trains comprises 10 electric units (EMU) and 12 bimodal units (BMU). They will consist of 3 aluminium car-bodies with a maximum capacity for 375 passengers, 214 of them seated, with one additional generator car in bimodal units. These trains can reach a maximum speed of 160 respectively 140 kilometres per hour, depending on the power source used. The trains will have a length of 63.2 metres (207 ft 4+1⁄4 in) (EMU) and 74.4 metres (244 ft 1+1⁄8 in) (BMU). Delivery is expected for late 2024.
Serbia
Serbian Railways have ordered 21 FLIRT3 EMUs for regional traffic and were delivered in 2014 and 2015. In 2022 further 18 units were ordered with deliveries expected to start from 2023. Trains are numbered ŽS 413/417.
Slovenia
Slovenian Railways ordered 11 235-passenger FLIRT EMUs (SŽ 510/515) and 5 171-passenger DMUs (SŽ 610/615) in April 2018, for delivery by early 2020 and exercised an option for a further 10 EMUs and 16 DMUs in May 2019 for delivery by late 2021, bringing the total order up to 21 4-car EMUs and 21 3-car DMUs. Together with 10 Stadler KISS units there are 52 Stadler trainsets in Slovenia as of October 2022.
Spain
Renfe's Cercanías division ordered 24 100 m (328 ft 1 in) trains and 35 200 m (656 ft 2 in) combined FLIRT/KISS EMUs in 1,668 mm (5 ft 5+21⁄32 in) for Cercanías Madrid and Rodalies de Catalunya in 2021, which are expected to enter service in 2024, replacing older rolling stock dating from the 1970s to the early-1990s. The 100 m variants will consist of two single-deck FLIRT end cars connected to two bilevel KISS intermediate cars, while the 200 m variants will feature additional two single-deck FLIRT intermediate cars.
Sweden
MTRX ordered six Flirt EMUs for inter-city operation between Stockholm and Gothenburg. They are very similar to the Norwegian units, maximum 200 km/h, but have more comfortable seats aimed for longer distances, and a small café area. The first unit was delivered in November 2014. They started customer operation in March 2015.
Transitio in 2014 signed an agreement with Stadler, CAF and Bombardier, that these three companies are chosen to get orders for regional and local trains during 2015–2021. Transitio is a train purchasing company owned by the regional transport authorities in Sweden. The rolling stock chosen was ER1 which was delivered from 2020.
Switzerland
The Swiss Federal Railways were Stadler's first customer for the FLIRT when they ordered 42 units with options for 100 more in September 2002. The first vehicle was delivered in 2004 for the use on the Stadtbahn Zug.
Meanwhile, the Swiss Federal Railways have ordered a total of 117 units that can be broken down into 4 different types that differ in their equipment for driving in neighboring countries. The base version is the RABe 523 that is used on the Stadtbahn Zug and the RER Vaud. These 43 4-section units can only be used within Switzerland. The 30 RABe 521 and 14 RABe 522 are versions that can also be used in Germany and France respectively. They also consist of 4 sections and are used on the Basel S-Bahn. The last version is the Italy-capable RABe 524/ETR 150 that is used on Treni Regionali Ticino Lombardia (TILO) services in Ticino and northern Italy. The first 19 units of this type to be delivered were 4 sections long, and were followed by eleven units ordered that six-sections long and are additionally equipped with the ETCS Level 2 train control system.
In December 2018, SBB ordered 7 trains, with an option of 7 more. They will be manufactured 2019–2021. Each train has four single-deck cars, with a total of 27 seats in first class and 154 in second class. The SBB name is 'Mouette' (Seagull).
Besides the Swiss Federal Railways two other companies in Switzerland operate FLIRT trains: The Südostbahn (SOB) uses several trains with the designation RABe 526 (FLIRT and FLIRT-III, including the Traverso used as Voralpen Express, Treno Gottardo, and Aare-Linth). The Transports Publics Neuchâtelois (TransN) owns 3 RABe 527 and 4 RABe 523 trains.
BLS AG ordered 58 6-car EMU sets in May 2017 for service on RegioExpress and Bern S-Bahn routes, with delivery scheduled to take place between 2021 and 2026.
United Kingdom
In August 2016 Greater Anglia selected Stadler FLIRT electric and bi-mode units for the East Anglia franchise, to replace its Class 90 electric locomotives, Mark 3 carriages and Driving Van Trailers, Class 153, 156 and 170 diesel multiple units and Class 379 electric multiple units. This was to comprise 14 3-car and 24 4-car bi-mode multiple units (Class 755) and 20 12-car electric multiple units (Class 745) (of which 10 will be used for Stansted Express and 10 for Intercity services).
In June 2018, KeolisAmey Wales announced it would purchase thirty-five FLIRTs: 24 tri-mode (7 3-car and 17 4-car) units and 11 4-car diesel-electric units for the South Wales Metro.
United States
On 9 June 2015 Trinity Metro signed a contract for the supply of eight 4-car articulated FLIRT3 diesel-electric multiple units for the TEXRail commuter line, which opened in January 2019. The contract was signed at a ceremony held at Fort Worth Central Station. The contract is valued at $107 million, and includes the supply of components for 10 years. The contract also includes an option for an additional 24 DMUs. This is Stadler's first order for its FLIRT family in the US (previous orders have been for the GTW), and the first to include federal funding and thus be subject to the Buy America Act. As such, one element of the contract is that the final assembly of the trains will take place in the US, and several assembly sites such as in Lewisville were considered for the facility. Stadler eventually leased space from the Utah Transit Authority in their former Union Pacific shops in Salt Lake City, Utah.
Public unveiling events for the completed American-built FLIRT units occurred in both Atlanta, Georgia on 9 October 2017 and Salt Lake City, on the Salt Lake, Garfield and Western Railway, on 13 October 2017 as Stadler broke ground for their permanent Salt Lake facility.

Three 2-car FLIRT sets were built for Arrow service in Redlands, California, which started operation in 2022. The $31.4 million contract includes the vehicles themselves, spare parts, and training for servicing and operation. In November 2019, the San Bernardino County Transportation Authority ordered an additional FLIRT powered via hydrogen fuel cell, the first such train in the United States. In September 2022, an order of four additional hydrogen-powered trains were announced by Stadler and CalSTA for Amtrak California inter-city services.
Eight 4-car sets are to enter service with Dallas Area Rapid Transit on the Silver Line when it opens in 2024.
Potential operators
Philippines
The Department of Transportation (DOTr) is procuring 56 airport express EMU cars for its North–South Commuter Railway project, which will be operated by the Philippine National Railways (PNR). Bids commenced on 15 October 2021 with three contractors offered their proposed designs. One of the three bidders is Japanese firm Marubeni who partnered with Stadler Rail and formed their own joint venture. The venture proposes a high-floor variant of the FLIRT200. Unlike the presently-available variants of the FLIRT, the trains will have a floor height of 1,150 mm (45 in) to support the line's 1,100 mm (43 in) platforms. It will also run on standard gauge track and will use 1.5 kilovolt DC power. The maximum operational speed for these trains shall be at 160 km/h (99 mph) and the maximum line speed will be at 180 km/h (110 mph).
If this bid succeeds, manufacture will also coincide with the completion of Stadler/INKA plant in Banyuwangi, Indonesia. The trains are expected to be supplied between 2023 and 2027, entering trial service between Clark International Airport and Buendia station by 2026.
Cancelled contracts
Latvia
On 1 July 2014 Latvian rail operator Pasažieru vilciens announced that it would acquire FLIRT trains as part of a hire/purchase contract, however Pv owner Latvian Railways ultimately withdrew the contract and no procurement went ahead.
