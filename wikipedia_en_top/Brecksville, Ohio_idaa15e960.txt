History
Brecksville was founded in 1811, four years after several men—including Colonel John Breck—purchased the surrounding area.  After the land was surveyed, Seth Payne, one of the surveyors, brought his family and settled in the area in June 1811, and he was soon followed by many other families.  Although Colonel Breck never lived in Brecksville, his three sons did, and members of his family continued to live in Brecksville until 1934, when his great-grandson Dr. Theodore Breck died.  An early historical account of Brecksville was written by William R. Coates and published by The American Historical Society in 1924.
Brecksville was incorporated as a village in 1921, and it gained the status of city in 1960.
