History
On 7 July 1963, the People's Republic of Montenegro (Serbo-Croatian: Narodna Republika Crna Gora / Народна Република Црна Гора) was renamed the "Socialist Republic of Montenegro" (a change ratified both by the Federal Constitution and the newly created Montenegrin Constitution in 1963) with Serbo-Croatian as the official language. In 1991, as the League of Communists of Montenegro changed its name to Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro after the first multi-party elections, the adjective "Socialist" was deleted from the republic's title (ratified by the Constitutional Amendment LXXXIV of August 2 in 1991).The Flag and Emblem was changed in 1993 December
