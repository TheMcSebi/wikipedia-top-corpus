In October 2017, he was made an honorary patron for Capital Theatre's campaign to modernise the historic King's Theatre Edinburgh and preserve it for future generations. In January 2020, he was removed from patronage of the Mid-Lin Daycare Centre, a centre for the elderly in Dundee,  after serving for four years due to his confession of his use and endorsement of recreational cannabis.

Bibliography
He has authored three books: Salem to Moscow: An Actors Odyssey, The Lear Diaries, and his autobiography Putting the Rabbit in the Hat.
Salem to Moscow: An Actors Odyssey spans 30 years in British theatre, beginning in the 1980s, when Cox, despite success on both sides of the Atlantic, was looking for a new sense of purpose for his life and work which culminates having first directed The Crucible at the Moscow Art Theatre School.
In The Lear Diaries, Cox accounts how a group of leading actors approach a major text, providing insight into the pressures that contemporary theatre actors face. He describes the emotional and physical difficulties that came with playing King Lear while also working as a member of an ensemble playing roles in Richard III. His diary also reveals the personal strains of touring, particularly the difficulties of being separated from his family during the company's year-long tour.
Cox credits a remark from fellow actor Oliver Cotton during the production as resulting in the title of his autobiography Putting The Rabbit In The Hat published in 2021.
Personal life
Marriages and family
Cox is divorced from his second wife, Caroline Burt. They have two children, Margaret and Alan; the latter is also an actor, best known for his roles in Young Sherlock Holmes, and as the young John Mortimer in the television film of his play A Voyage Round My Father (1982) opposite Laurence Olivier. Cox married his third wife, actress Nicole Ansari, in 2002. They have two sons, Orson Jonathan Cox and Torin Kamran Cox, and live in New York City. Cox also maintains a home in Primrose Hill, London.
Politics
In 2007, Cox campaigned for Labour in the run-up to that year's Scottish Parliamentary elections. However, he endorsed the Scottish National Party in the 2011 election because of their higher education policy. Cox told Alastair Campbell that he was an active and committed Labour supporter all his life, until – “you won’t like this,”  the Iraq War.  On 25 May 2012, he spoke in support of Scottish independence at the Yes Scotland campaign. However Cox did not qualify for a vote in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum as his status as a tax exile, living in the United States greatly limits the number of days he can spend in the United Kingdom. On 29 January 2015, he announced he had quit the Labour Party, believing it had failed to live up to its basic principles, and joined the Scottish National Party, whom he felt was taking forward values of social justice and representing Scotland's best interests.
In January 2020, despite stating he is unlikely to ever return to live in Scotland, he called for a second referendum on Scottish independence, saying Labour had "failed" in Scotland and that Scots were "organically" moving towards a decision to leave the UK following the Brexit referendum.
In November 2022, Cox insisted that he did not consider himself a Scottish nationalist and described himself as an Anglophile but felt too many political decisions were being made on Scotland's behalf. He also claimed to favour a move towards federalism and constitutional change in the United Kingdom over Scottish independence and said "I don't want to break up the Union but I want another idea for the Union" which he described as "independent states but we come together as a united federation."
Cox confirmed in an interview to The Guardian that he supported the recreational use of cannabis: "It's absolutely great and I recommend it to everyone—get stoned!"
Honours and office
On 31 December 2002, Cox was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours List.  In 1994, he was made an Honorary Doctor of Laws Honoris Causa by the University of Dundee. In 2006, he was conferred an Honorary Doctorate of Drama by the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. In July 2007, he was made an Honorary Doctor of Letters by Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh, and was made an Honorary Doctor of Drama by Napier University in Edinburgh in July 2008. In November 2011, he was named an Honorary Doctor of Letters by Kingston University in southwest London for his tireless contributions to drama education.
In February 2010, Cox was elected as the 12th Rector of the University of Dundee by its students, was formally installed in October, and was re-elected in January 2013. In December 2018 he was appointed head of the international jury at the Golden Unicorn Awards.
