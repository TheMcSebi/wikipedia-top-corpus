Other uses
While Ethiopia and Eritrea both officially use UTC+03:00, Ethiopian and Eritrean culture follow a time system with two 12-hour cycles for day and night, and is 6 hours "slower" than the official time. The day begins with the day cycle at sunrise (6:00 a.m., but designated as 12 o'clock by local rendition) till sunset, followed by the night cycle (official 6:00 p.m., unofficial 12:00 night cycle). Therefore, the people of Ethiopia and Eritrea effectively follow UTC−03:00 instead of UTC+03:00.
