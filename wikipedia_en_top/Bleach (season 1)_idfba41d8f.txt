Bleach (season 1)
The Agent of the Soul Reaper Saga (死神代行篇, Shinigami Daikō Hen) is the first season of the Bleach anime series. The episodes are directed by Noriyuki Abe, and produced by TV Tokyo, Dentsu and Studio Pierrot. In the English release by Viz Media, the title is changed to The Substitute. The season adapts the first eight volumes (chapters 1–70) of Tite Kubo's Bleach manga series, spanning twenty episodes. The episodes' plot covers the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki after becoming a Soul Reaper and assuming the duties of Soul Reaper Rukia Kuchiki.
The arc initially ran from October 5, 2004 to February 22, 2005 in Japan on TV Tokyo. The first English airing of the series was from September 9, 2006 until January 26, 2007.

The arc started airing in the UK starting in September 2007 on AnimeCentral.
The episodes use three pieces of theme music: one opening theme and two ending themes. The opening theme is Orange Range's single "Asterisk". The ending theme for the first thirteen episodes is "Life is Like a Boat" by Rie Fu, while the remaining seven used "Thank You!!" by Home Made Kazoku.
