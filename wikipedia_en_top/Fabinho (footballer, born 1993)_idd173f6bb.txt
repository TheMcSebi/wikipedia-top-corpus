Style of play
Fabinho is regarded as one of the best defensive midfielders in the world, with Sky Sports pundit and former Manchester United player Gary Neville saying, "Fabinho... is the best." He is a robust, agile player who is valued for his ability to win back the ball in the midfield and recycle possession quickly. His role as defensive midfielder sometimes requires him to drop further back to play as a third centre-back to cover for Liverpool's fullbacks Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold. His reading of the game is considered outstanding and has led to him being nicknamed 'The Lighthouse' by Liverpool assistant coach Pepijn Lijnders and his teammates.
Personal life
Fabinho married Rebeca Tavares in 2015, having been together since 2013. The couple revealed Rebeca was pregnant with their first child in July 2022. At Liverpool, he earned himself the nickname, "The Hoover," because according to teammate Joe Gomez, "he cleans up everything." He decided to keep "Fabinho" on his shirt instead of his given names because his mother recommended he do so.
