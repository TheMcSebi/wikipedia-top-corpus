Tekken Tag Tournament 2
Tekken Tag Tournament 2 is a sequel to the Tekken fighting game series. It was released for the arcades in September 2011. It received an update, subtitled Unlimited, on March 2012. A console version based on the update was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2012, prior to the update. It was ported to the Wii U as one of the system's launch titles in November 2012, subtitled Wii U Edition. It is the eighth installment in the Tekken fighting game series.


As with the original Tekken Tag Tournament (1999), the game includes almost every character from past Tekken games, giving it the largest playable roster in a Tekken game to date. Players can choose either a team of two characters on each side or a solo character. Tekken Tag Tournament 2 has been positively received by critics, earning averaged review scores in the range of 82-83% at both GameRankings and Metacritic for the PlayStation 3, Wii U and Xbox 360 versions, as well as several fighting-game-of-the-year awards.
Gameplay
Like the original Tekken Tag Tournament, matches involve each player selecting two fighters to fight with. Players are able to switch their fighters out at any time, allowing the inactivating character to gradually recover some life they might have lost. At certain points, an inactive character's life bar may flash, giving them a temporary boost in strength if they are tagged in. If the life bar of either of a player's fighters runs out, that player loses the round. If time runs out, the player who has the most cumulative life remaining amongst their fighters wins the round.
The gameplay expands on the tag mechanics featured in the first Tekken Tag, allowing for extended tag combos and combined moves. New techniques include combined tag throws which, if timed properly, can be escaped from. Tag combos (referred to as "Tag Assaults") can be done simultaneously with both characters participating in the combo at the same time. The game inherits gameplay features from Tekken 6, such as "Bound" hits (hits that slam an airborne opponent to the ground and stun them so combos can be extended) and walled arenas, some of which featuring walls and floors that can be broken through during the fight. Character customization is also featured, similar to past Tekken games.
Features suggested by Katsuhiro Harada include recording in Practice mode as well as a Tutorial, to make the game more accessible for new players. The game features a "stage gimmick" system. For instance, an example of the system shown has the player slamming their opponent into wall, which breaks and the opponent goes flying, landing in a new area where the fight continues. As the opponent falls, the tag partner is waiting at the bottom to continue the combo.
The game features various modes, allowing players to choose between Tag Team (2 vs 2), Single (1 vs 1), or Handicap Matches ( 2 vs 1 or 1 vs 2), options for four players to play in a single match, and various online modes. Along with returning modes such as Arcade, Versus, Team Battle, Time Attack and Survival, a new mode called Fight Lab allows players to train a Combot through various challenges. The game also features various items that can alter the gameplay, ranging from weapons such as firearms and hammer hats to superficial items such as specialized KOs, and allows players to customize their fighters with various accessories.
The Wii U Edition includes the return of the mini-game Tekken Ball from Tekken 3 and a Mushroom Battle mode in which various mushrooms from the Mario series litter the arena, causing players to grow or shrink in size or take extra damage.  It also features optional touch-based controls using the system's gamepad, as well as costumes based on Nintendo media franchise. There is also another exclusive mode called Tekken Supporters, where players can donate their in game currency to the characters for items you can't get in the Customization mode or bonuses earned from Ghost Battle.
Plot
Unlike the original Tekken Tag Tournament, the game's sequel features a storyline although it is still not the series canon. However, certain characters' endings are canon, which are followed in the sequel game Tekken 7. In the story, Heihachi Mishima has developed a rejuvenation serum, which has the ability to regress his appearance and power. After consuming it, Heihachi hosts another King of Iron Fist Tournament, sensing powerful challengers who would come to the tournament.
In "Fight Lab" section of the game, Lee Chaolan, under the guise of Violet is working on a new version of Combot. As soon as Combot is complete, Violet begins its simulation test. After the simulation test, the Combot explodes and destroys the lab. Violet decides to use the other functioning Combot to complete the tests. After Combot completes five tests, Violet kidnaps Jin, Kazuya and Heihachi for Combot's final test. Combot apparently has the upper hand, but Jin transforms into his Devil form and destroys it. Violet blows up the Combot, presumably taking the Mishima bloodline with it, and says, "Excellent!".
Characters
The arcade version features all 41 playable characters from Tekken 6 (including Panda except with her own character slot) along with Jun Kazama from Tekken 2, True Ogre (known in-game as just "Ogre") from Tekken 3 and Jinpachi Mishima from Tekken 5 all with updated character designs. Devil Kazuya from the original Tekken also makes an appearance as an in-game transformation of Kazuya. Unknown from the original Tekken Tag Tournament also returns, once again as an unplayable final boss with an updated set of visuals. In the home release, she became a playable character via an update patch. The game also introduces a masked character named Jaycee, an alter-ego of Julia Chang.
The console release of the game features a total of 59 characters, including the return of Kunimitsu, Michelle Chang and Prototype Jack from the original Tekken, Angel and Alex from Tekken 2, Tiger Jackson, Forest Law, Dr. Bosconovitch and Ancient Ogre (originally known as just "Ogre") from Tekken 3, as well as Tekken 4's Miharu Hirano, Violet and Combot, the latter of which can be customized with various moves from other characters. A slim version of Bob from his Tekken 6 ending and Lili's butler since Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection, Sebastian make their debut as playable characters.
Unlike previous installments, certain characters who originally did not speak in their native language, now do. Characters include Lili and Sebastian who speak French, Eddy and Christie speaking Portuguese, Dr. Bosconovitch speaking Russian, Leo speaking German and Miguel speaking Spanish. Exceptions include Lee Chaolan, Lars, Xiaoyu, and Alisa, who still speak Japanese, as well as Lei and Lee's alter-ego Violet, who still speaks English due to their further character backgrounds despite their actual nationalities.

Development
Tekken series producer Katsuhiro Harada teased an announcement on his Twitter feed on September 17, 2010 ("TGS Sep 18(Sat) at Tougeki Booth. I'll announce something :D"). It was rumored to be something related to Tekken X Street Fighter or Tekken 7. The game was announced to be Tekken Tag Tournament 2, sequel to Tekken Tag Tournament, on September 18, 2010, at the Tougeki event as promised. Producer Katsuhiro Harada stated that the game engine would be different from the one used in Tekken 6. The release of the arcade version of the game in Japan was originally planned for summer 2011, but due to complications derived from the Great East Japan earthquake, the arcade release was postponed until Autumn 2011. At the World Cyber Games 2010, Harada stated that the console version would feature additional console-exclusive returning characters and bonus gameplay modes. He also suggested that the release of the console version of the game would take place between the releases of Street Fighter X Tekken and Tekken X Street Fighter.
Tekken Tag Tournament 2 Unlimited
Tekken Tag Tournament 2 Unlimited is an update to original arcade release, Tekken Tag Tournament 2. It features a number of new items and customization options. It also gives the game a balance update from characters and items. It was released to arcades on March 27, 2012, and the console version of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 is based on this arcade version.
In the Unlimited version, the player can switch a ratio between Tag mode and Solo mode ("2 vs 2", "1 vs 2" or "1 vs 1"). There is also a Pair Play mode, which allows four players to fight simultaneously in pairs of two, much like the "Scramble Mode" in Street Fighter X Tekken. The Unlimited version features the Rage system from Tekken 6 for Solo mode characters, and the new tag partner Rage system from the original arcade version of Tag Tournament 2 for Tag mode characters only. Rage gives characters more damage per hit when their vitality is below a certain point. Once activated, a reddish energy aura appears around the character, and their health bar starts to flicker in red. The Netsu Power appears when an on-screen character gets attacked a certain number of times and the off-screen character's lifebar flashes. If the on-screen character tags out while the off-screen character's lifebar is flashing, the tagged character becomes slightly stronger.
Console versions
The console version of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2012, and for the Wii U in Novemberâ€“December 2012.

Reception
Tekken Tag Tournament 2 has been met with a positive critical response, with aggregating review website Metacritic assigning the Wii U version 83/100, Xbox 360 version 83/100 and PlayStation 3 version 82/100. During its first month of sale, it shifted 840,000 copies in Europe and Japan. As of January 2013, 1.35 million copies have been sold worldwide. By March 2013 the game had sold 1.5 million copies worldwide. The game reached number 2 in the UK sales charts.
In Famitsu, the game scored a rating of 39/40 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, which was the magazine's highest score for a traditional fighting game since Dead or Alive 4 in 2005. Joystiq applauded the game for including everything that makes Tekken good, stating "its surprisingly deep, accessible gameplay mechanics to its bombastic and hilarious attitude â€“ all presented in a package more polished and refined than ever before." GameSpot hailed this "well-executed and punishing fighter" for its combat system, online play, the Fight Lab mode, and customizable soundtrack, but criticized the inadequate tutorial modes. According to Eurogamer, "It plays it a little safe in places and lacks a truly killer single-player mode, but by broadening the versatility of the tag system while dramatically improving the online functionality, Namco has crafted a new teamwork seminar that builds upon the original in almost all the areas that matter." IGN was more critical of the game that while approving the core gameplay and content, felt that the similar gameplay of its predecessors made it difficult for newcomers of the series. Game Informer noted that the game does not overhaul the franchise, but retains the series' already solid gameplay, adding: "It offers a ton of fighters, the tag system is interesting, it plays well online, and it preserves the goofy sense of humor that defines the series. Even with a somewhat bare-bones online offering, itâ€™s still one of the most refined fighters on the market." GameTrailers wrote: "Spinoff or not, this is the best Tekken game in years."
Awards
Tekken Tag Tournament 2 was one of the four games nominated at the 2012 Spike TV Video Game Awards in the category "Best Fighting Game", losing to Persona 4 Arena. GameSpot awarded Tekken Tag Tournament 2 "Fighting Game of 2012",
