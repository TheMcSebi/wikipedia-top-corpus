Development of web series
Glazer and Jacobson met in New York City, where they both attended courses at the Upright Citizens Brigade and were part of a small improv comedy group, Secret Promise Circle. The web series began after Jacobson received poor feedback on a project she and a partner had been working on. Jacobson expressed her frustration to Glazer, and the two decided to work together on a project that became the web series. In February 2010 they started their own web series on YouTube, which proved popular.
Jacobson met Paul W. Downs in improv class and both Jacobson and Glazer met Lucia Aniello through the Upright Citizens Brigade. Both were fans of the web series pilot and Aniello would then direct one episode of the web series. The web series ran for two seasons and the finale starred Amy Poehler.
Development of TV pilot and first season
Amy Poehler became aware of the series and mentored Glazer and Jacobson, becoming executive producer when the show came to TV. When Glazer and Jacobson wrote the pilot script, their characters were named Evelyn Wexler and Carly Abrams respectively, but ended up using their real first names instead. Poehler, Glazer, and Jacobson went to Los Angeles to pitch the pilot. The show was originally pitched to the FX, who bought the script and passed a year later, due to it being "too girly", according to Jacobson. Comedy Central committed to the show in 2012 and the pilot was developed, with Aniello directing. For the first season, Jacobson and Glazer were paired with Tami Sagher, an experienced showrunner, with Downs, Aniello, and Chris Kelly completing the writing room. Downs and Aniello would also produce the show, with Downs appearing as Trey in the series.
Throughout its run, the show featured notable guest stars including Wanda Sykes, Kelly Ripa, Amy Poehler, Fran Drescher, Shania Twain, Hillary Clinton, and RuPaul. Broad City: High Score, a mobile game developed and published by Built Games, was released on April 20, 2018.
Second season
After the first season, Glazer and Jacobson parted ways with Sagher and became the showrunners. The second season premiered on January 14, 2015, and was renewed for a third season ahead of the premiere.
Final season
Glazer and Jacobson decided to end the show after five seasons. Of their final season, Glazer said: "I feel like we've raised these kids, Abbi Abrams and Ilana Wexler, and we're sending them to college", Glazer says. "We didn't want to just go until it got canceled. We wanted to choose to end it so that it could end as strong as possible. We chose this ending to honor the characters." In their final season, Glazer and Jacobson open with an episode that unfolds like a long Instagram story. Throughout the season, the characters go to MoMA as well as drag brunch.

The A.V. Club critic Caroline Framke wrote that Broad City was "worth watching" despite its "well-trod premise", and that the series is "remarkably self-possessed, even in its first episode."

Ben Travers from Indiewire summarizes what he sees as the strengths of the first two episodes of season 3: "Each half-hour feels as free-wheeling and wild as Ilana so boldly is, but also as meticulously put-together as Abby [sic] strives to be ... the integration of its two creators attitudes into the core makeup of the series helps to illustrate how groundbreaking Broad City really is."
