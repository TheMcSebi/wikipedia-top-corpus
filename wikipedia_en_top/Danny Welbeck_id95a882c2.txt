Club career
Manchester United
Welbeck was first spotted by Manchester United as a six-year-old. At eight years old, he impressed with local team Fletcher Moss Rangers, and was finally picked up by the Manchester United youth academy. He joined United during the 2005–06 season, making his debut for the club's under-18 team on 8 April 2006 in a league match against Sunderland.

He was not handicapped despite suffering from Osgood–Schlatter disease, and was making rapid progress, despite his pneumonia.
Welbeck signed his first trainee contract in July 2007, and started the 2007–08 season in the under-18 team, but was quickly promoted to the reserve team, making a number of substitute appearances. Then, in January 2008, he was called up to the first team for the trip to Saudi Arabia to play Al-Hilal in Sami Al-Jaber's testimonial match. Welbeck made his debut in that match on 21 January 2008, coming on as a 65th-minute substitute for Anderson. Welbeck had the chance to snatch a draw for United when he was brought down in the penalty area in the final minute, but he put the penalty kick over the bar.
He joined the first-team squad partway through the 2007–08 season, and made his competitive debut for the Manchester United first team on 23 September 2008, starting up front in a 3–1 home win against Middlesbrough in the League Cup Third Round. Welbeck's Premier League debut was made on 15 November 2008, coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute for Park Ji-sung against Stoke City.

On 25 January 2010, Welbeck became Alex Ferguson's son Darren Ferguson's first signing as Preston North End manager since he took charge earlier in the month, signing on loan for the remainder of the 2009–10 season. As part of his recovery, he took part in a training session at Manchester United's training ground, but his knee swelled up again. The injury required surgery and Welbeck's loan was cut short on 16 March so that he could return to Manchester United for the operation.
On 12 August 2010, Welbeck became Steve Bruce's eighth summer signing after Sunderland signed the United striker on loan for the duration of the 2010–11 season. His debut for Sunderland came on 14 August as an 83rd-minute substitute for Darren Bent in a 2–2 home draw against Birmingham City. On 14 November, Welbeck scored his first Sunderland goal as he completed the scoring in a 3–0 away victory over Chelsea, rounding off what was described as an "impressive individual performance". Eight days later, Welbeck scored his first home goals for Sunderland, striking twice in a 2–2 draw with Everton.
Welbeck scored the only goal as Sunderland beat Bolton Wanderers on 18 December 2010, and also scored on 1 January 2011 as Sunderland defeated Blackburn Rovers 3–0. His form for Sunderland prompted widespread calls for an England call up, but on 5 January, he picked up a hamstring injury in a victory at Aston Villa, ruling him out for eight weeks. He made his return on 5 March 2011, in a 0–0 draw away to Arsenal, coming on as a substitute for Steed Malbranque in the 68th minute; he almost scored a late goal that would have won the match for Sunderland in the 83rd minute, but his shot was saved by Wojciech Szczęsny.

Welbeck opened the scoring in an eventual 8–2 win over Arsenal. From outside the box, Anderson chipped the ball into Welbeck and he headed it over Wojciech Szczęsny.

Arsenal
On 2 September 2014, in the late hours of deadline day, Welbeck joined Arsenal on a "long-term deal" for a £16 million fee. Stating the reason for his departure to a direct rival, Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal said "Welbeck doesn't have the record of Robin van Persie or Wayne Rooney.

Welbeck left Manchester United having made a total of 142 appearances, scoring 29 goals.
Welbeck made his Arsenal debut against the previous season's champions Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium in a 2–2 draw on 13 September.

After being away for eight months due to the knee injury, Welbeck was named part of Arsenal's squad in the FA Cup match against his former club Preston on 7 January 2017.
