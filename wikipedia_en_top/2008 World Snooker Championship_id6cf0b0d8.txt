Overview
The World Snooker Championship is an annual cue sport tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. Founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India, the sport was popular in Great Britain. In modern times it has been played worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand. The event  was sponsored by 888.com.
In the 2008 tournament, 32 professional players competed in one-on-one snooker matches played over several frames, using a single-elimination tournament format. The 32 players were selected for the event using the  snooker world rankings and a pre-tournament qualification competition. In 1927, the first world championship was won by Joe Davis. The event's final took place in Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, England. Since 1977, the event has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The event was organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. Scotsman John Higgins was the defending champion, having defeated Mark Selby 18–13 in the previous years final.

Tournament summary
Early rounds
The first round was played between 20 and 24 April as the best of 19 frames, held over two sessions. Defending champion John Higgins defeated Matthew Stevens 10–5, but runner-up Mark Selby was knocked out by qualifier Mark King 10–8. Ding Junhui's 10–9 victory over Marco Fu was his first ever win at the Crucible. Stephen Maguire took the first eight frames in the first session of his first round match against Anthony Hamilton, before Hamilton won frame 9. Maguire won the match 10–3. Three players were making their debuts at the event; Jamie Cope, Liu Chuang  and Liang Wenbo. Of the three, Wenbo won their first round match, as he defeated Ken Doherty 10–5. The defeat caused Doherty to drop out of the top 16 of the World Rankings for the first time since the 1992/93 season. Cope lost in a deciding frame to Peter Ebdon despite having led 5–2 up earlier on.
The second round was played from 24 to 28 April as the best of 25 frames, held over three sessions. Defending champion Higgins was defeated by Ryan Day 9–13. This was the first time Day had progressed to the quarter-finals at the event. Ronnie O'Sullivan made a maximum break against Mark Williams in the final frame of his 13–7 win. Williams, ranked twelfth in the world before the tournament, fell out of the top 16 after the loss. Hendry reached the quarter-finals for the seventeenth time in his career, after a 13–7 win over Ding Junhui. Maguire also won the first eight frames of the match in his second round clash with Neil Robertson, which he won 13–7. Leading at 12–10, Liang Wenbo punched the air in celebration as he potted match ball. However, his opponent, Joe Swail earned the snookers he required, and also won the next frame to force the match into a deciding frame. Swail missed a brown ball allowing Wenbo to win the match 13–12. After the match, Swail complained bitterly that in the final frame the referee had incorrectly replaced the cue ball after calling a miss, giving Liang an easier escape from a snooker, and accused Liang of unprofessional conduct for not pointing out the referee's mistake.
Later rounds (Quarter-finals—final)
The quarter-finals were played on 29 and 30 April as the best of 25 frames held over three sessions. Carter made a maximum break in his 13–9 win over Ebdon. His opponent came very close to a maximum of his own just a frame earlier, but narrowly missed the fifteenth black. Just minutes before on the other table, Stephen Hendry was also attempting a maximum of his own but also missed the fifteenth red. Hendry reached the 12th Crucible semi-final of his career after a 13–7 win over Day, setting a record for one-table appearances that still stands. Wenbo was the first player from mainland China to reach the quarter-finals of the world championships, but lost 7–13 to O'Sullivan. Perry defeated Maguire on a deciding frame 13–12.
The semi-finals were played from the 1 to 3 May as the best of 33 frames. After tying the first session 4–4, O'Sullivan completed an 8–0 whitewash over Hendry in their second session, and won the first frame of session three, meaning that O'Sullivan had won twelve consecutive frames from 1–4 down to 13–4 in front. At one point O'Sullivan scored 448 points without reply. This was the first time Hendry had lost every frame in a full session at the Crucible. O'Sullivan won the match 17–6 with a session to spare. Carter reached his first ranking final by defeating Perry 17–15.
The final was played on 4 and 5 May between O'Sullivan and Carter. Both men were English for the first time since the 1991 event, when John Parrott defeated Jimmy White 18–11. O'Sullivan led 11–5 after the first day's play and won the match 18–8. This was O'Sullivan's third world championship joining Steve Davis and Hendry having won than two World titles at the Crucible; and was his 20th career ranking title. In post-match interviews, both players admitted to not having played particularly well, with O'Sullivan commenting "Ali and I are disappointed not to put on a better performance". Carter's performance was described as "jaded". The win also gave O'Sullivan the top spot in the world rankings.
