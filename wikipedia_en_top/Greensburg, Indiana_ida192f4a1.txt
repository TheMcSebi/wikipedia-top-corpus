Tree on the Courthouse Tower
The Decatur County Courthouse in Greensburg is known for a tree which grows from the top of the Courthouse Tower, giving Greensburg its nickname, "Tree City".
There have been one or more trees growing continually since the first tree was noticed in the early 1870s. Later, other small trees appeared on the clock tower.
County officials were initially concerned that the trees would cause damage to the roof, and a steeplejack was hired in the 1880s to remove some of them. Two trees were left, with one ultimately growing to a height of nearly 15 feet (4.6 m). By the time it died, another tree had appeared.
Today, there are two trees on the tower. During a recent tree trimming a piece of the tree was examined by several Purdue University foresters and they positively identified the tree as a mulberry tree.
Healthcare
Decatur County Memorial Hospital has served the community since 1922. The facility offers a full range of both inpatient and outpatient services including 24/7 Emergency services. Hyperbaric Oxygen Chambers are available in the Center for Wound Healing at DCMH and the Hospital was one of the first in the state to acquire a 128-slice CT scanner. The Hospital Foundation of Decatur County has served to provide financial support for the facility and its programs. Major capital campaigns in 1995 and 2003 helped fund significant growth in the facility. A vertical expansion will add two floors to the 2003 addition including a new medical/surgical unit with all private rooms.
In addition to the main campus the Hospital owns the Medical Arts Plaza at 955 N. Michigan Ave., Greensburg. The 40,000 sq ft (3,700 m2) facility houses the Occupational Health program - "Workwell" and contains a lab, x-ray and the Tree City Medical Partners Physician's Practice as well as space for other physicians.
