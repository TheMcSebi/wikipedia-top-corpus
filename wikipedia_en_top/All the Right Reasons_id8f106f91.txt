All the Right Reasons
All the Right Reasons is the fifth studio album by Canadian rock band Nickelback, released on October 4, 2005, on Roadrunner Records. It is the band's first album with former 3 Doors Down drummer Daniel Adair, who replaced Ryan Vikedal in January 2005. The album topped the Canadian Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200 albums chart and has sold 11 million copies worldwide. It is Nickelback's best-selling album to date, according to certifications from the CRIA, the RIAA, the BPI, and the ARIA. Seven singles were released from the album. The album re-entered the Finland Albums Chart in 2010, setting a new peak position at number 21.
All the Right Reasons was certified diamond by the RIAA in March 2017 and had sold 7.96 million copies in the US as of December 2015, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time in the US. In Canada, All the Right Reasons was certified 7Ã— Platinum by the CRIA in March 2010.
Critical reception
The album received mixed to negative reviews, currently holding a score of 41 based on nine critics on Metacritic. However, Entertainment Weekly explained the album's success this way: "What if Nickelback's decision to let the music speak for itself is, ironically, their biggest selling point of all?" Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times criticized the lyrical content of the album, referring to it as "another brash but sullen CD with more of the worst rock lyrics ever recorded."
Commercial performance
The album was the third straight No. 1 album for the band in their native Canada. It sold more than 60,000 copies in its first week, topping their previous number 1 albums Silver Side Up and The Long Road (selling 43,000 and 45,000 copies). The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 323,350 copies in its first week in the United States. In the United States the album to date has sold over 8 million copies and was found again inside the top 10 of the Billboard 200 in its 99th, 100th, 101st, and 102nd weeks on the chart. The album had never been below number 30 on the Billboard 200 in 110 weeks, making Nickelback the first act to have an album in the top thirty of the Billboard 200 for its first 100 weeks since Shania Twain's 1997 album Come On Over stayed in the top thirty for 123 consecutive weeks following its release.
In addition, the album has spawned five top-twenty Hot 100 singles in the U.S.: "Photograph", "Savin' Me", "Far Away", "If Everyone Cared", and "Rockstar", making it one of only a handful of rock albums to ever produce five or more top-twenty U.S. hits. "Photograph", "Far Away", and "Rockstar" were all top ten singles on the Hot 100, making Nickelback the first rock band of the 2000s (decade) to have three top-ten hits from the same album.
In the UK, the album opened its chart run at number 13 before quickly leaving the top 75 with no top 20 singles, with "Savin' Me" being their first to miss the top 75 altogether. While being the band's smallest-selling UK album since Curb, it experienced, in early 2008, a resurrection due to the single "Rockstar" becoming Nickelback's highest-charting single ever in the UK. The album has now outpeaked its previous peak of number 13, reaching number 2 and has since been certified Platinum.
It was ranked number 13 on Billboard's 200 Albums of the Decade.
