Kazuyoshi Miura
Kazuyoshi Miura (三浦 知良, Miura Kazuyoshi, born 26 February 1967), often known simply as Kazu (nicknamed "King Kazu"), is a Japanese  professional footballer who plays as a forward for Japan Football League club Suzuka Point Getters on loan from Yokohama FC.
He played for the Japan national team from 1990 to 2000, and was the first Japanese recipient of the IFFHS Asia's Footballer of the Year award. Miura, whose rise to fame in Japan coincided with the launch of the J.League in 1993, was arguably Japan's first superstar in football. He is also known for his trademark "Kazu Feint" and his famous "Kazu dance", when he scores great goals or produces great plays.
Miura holds the records for being the oldest goalscorer in the J-League, the footballer with the world's longest professional career, and, as of 2023, is the oldest professional footballer in the world at 55. He also holds the unique distinction of having played professional football in five separate decades (1980s–2020s). His elder brother Yasutoshi is  also a former professional footballer.
Club career
Early career
In 1982, Miura left the Shizuoka Gakuen High School after less than a year, and travelled alone to Brazil at the age of fifteen to become a professional footballer there. He signed with the youth squad of São Paulo side Juventus, and in 1986, Miura signed his first professional contract with Santos. He played for several other Brazilian clubs, including Palmeiras and Coritiba, until his return to Japan in 1990.
Verdy Kawasaki
His time in Brazil elevated him to star status and on his return to Japan, he joined the Japan Soccer League (JSL) side Yomiuri SC, which later spun off from its parent company Yomiuri Shinbun and became Verdy Kawasaki with the launch of the J1 League in 1993. With Yomiuri/Kawasaki, Miura won four consecutive league titles playing alongside fellow Japanese national team regulars Ruy Ramos and Tsuyoshi Kitazawa. Yomiuri won the last two JSL titles in 1991 and 1992, and Verdy Kawasaki won the first two J1 League titles in 1993 and 1994. He was named the first J.League Most Valuable Player in 1993.
Loan to Genoa
Miura then became the first Japanese footballer to play in Italy, joining Genoa in the 1994–95 Serie A season. In his Italian stint, he played 21 times and scored one goal, during the Genoa derby against Sampdoria. On 15 January 1994, Miura assisted Antonio Manicone's match-winning goal against Padova.
Return to Verdy Kawasaki
He returned to Verdy Kawasaki for the 1995 season and played with them until the end of the 1998 season.
Dinamo Zagreb
Miura made another attempt at playing in Europe with Croatia Zagreb in 1999.
Return to Japan
He returned to Japan, however, following a brief trial with AFC Bournemouth, in the same year, and played with Kyoto Purple Sanga and Vissel Kobe.
Yokohama FC

In 2005, Miura signed for Yokohama FC in 2005. In 2007, Miura was selected for the 2007 J.League All-Star Soccer for J-East and played exceptionally well. 
In November 2015, Miura signed a new one-year contract with Yokohama FC at the age of 48. In January 2017, Miura signed another new one-year contract with Yokohama, taking his professional career into his fifties.
On 5 March 2017, Miura became the oldest ever player to feature in a professional match when he started in Yokohama's 1–1 draw against V-Varen Nagasaki. With 50 years and seven days, he surpassed the previous record held by Stanley Matthews from 1965 by two days. Seven days later, he broke Matthews' record for oldest goalscorer in professional football when he struck the only goal of a 1–0 win over Thespakusatsu Gunma.
In January 2018, he signed a new contract, and renewed it again in January 2019, January 2020, and January 2021.
On 5 August 2020, he started in a J.League Cup match against Sagan Tosu, becoming the oldest player to take to the pitch in Japan's league cup competition, at the age of 53 years, 5 months and 10 days.  By doing so, he surpassed the previous record of 42 years, 10 months set in 2017 by Yukio Tsuchiya.
On 23 September 2020, he started in the J1 League match against Kawasaki Frontale and in doing so became the oldest player to take to the pitch in a J1 League match and the oldest player ever in a football match in the highest national division worldwide. Miura played 57 minutes in this match.
Suzuka Point Getters
On 30 December 2021, it was reported that Miura had reached an agreement to join Suzuka Point Getters in the Japan Football League (JFL), the fourth tier of Japanese football. On 13 March 2022, Kazua, at the age of 55, made his debut for Suzuka Point Getters, in the first round of the Japan Football League, which led to 4,620 spectators to watch his debut, which is the highest attendance at a Suzuka home match, breaking their previous record of 1,308 spectators in 2019. His debut also meant he broke the record of the oldest player to have ever featured in a JFL match at 55 years old, with a 12-year gap to the previous record holder.  His presence at the club brought many curious spectators to see him in action, leading to Suzuka Point Getters having featured in nine of the ten matches with the highest attendance numbers throughout the 2022 season. This includes the match between Suzuka Point Getters and Criacao Shinjuku, that gathered a crowd of 16,218 people watching the match at the Japan National Stadium, where he featured in a 1–0 win for Suzuka on 9 October 2022. It broke the record of the biggest attendance on a single JFL match. On 30 October 2022, Kazu became the oldest player to score at the JFL having converted from the penalty spot at the 85th minute of the match, to seal Suzuka's 3–1 win against Tiamo Hirakata. He broke the record two weeks after, on 12 November 2022, becoming the oldest player to score at the JFL at 55 years and 259 days old. With this goal, he also became the oldest to score at the competition from an open play situation. From 30 October to 12 November of 2022, then, he played three times and scored two goals, making it the first time he scored two goals in a single season since 2016, while at Yokohama FC.
