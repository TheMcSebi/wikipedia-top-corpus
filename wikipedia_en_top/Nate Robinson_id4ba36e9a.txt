He was at one point considered by Knicks' coach Larry Brown to be demoted to the NBA Development League. He was instead placed on the Inactive List for 10 games between February 24 and March 11.
On November 11, 2006, Robinson blocked the 7'6" Yao Ming during the Knicks' 97-90 loss to the Houston Rockets. It became one of his career highlights owing to the unlikeliness of the event and Robinson's own athletic abilities.
On December 16, 2006, Robinson was one of the primary participants in the brawl between the Denver Nuggets and the Knicks. His fight with Nuggets guard J. R. Smith landed in the seats, and he was suspended for 10 games as a result.
Robinson competed in the 2007 Slam Dunk Contest to defend his 2006 title, and came in second place after Gerald Green. In the second round, Green's Boston Celtics teammate Paul Pierce brought out a cardboard cut-out of Robinson to dunk over, but Robinson came out and stood in its place instead, and Green jumped over him to complete the dunk.
In the 2007–08 season, Robinson averaged 12.7 points per game and was the team's leading scorer in 10 games. On March 8, 2008, he scored a career-high 45 points in a 114–120 overtime loss to the Portland Trail Blazers.

After remaining on the bench for nearly a month, Robinson made his return on January 1, 2010, against the Atlanta Hawks, and scored 41 points off the bench in the Knicks' overtime victory.

Robinson scored 12 unanswered points to bring the Bulls back and eventually win the game in triple overtime. He finished the game with 34 points, including 23 points in the 4th quarter, just one point shy of Michael Jordan's franchise playoff record.
