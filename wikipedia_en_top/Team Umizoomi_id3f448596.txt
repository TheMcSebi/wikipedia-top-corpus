Team Umizoomi
Team Umizoomi is an American live-action and computer-animated musical children's television series with an emphasis on mathematical concepts, such as counting, sequences, shapes, patterns, measurements, and equalities. Neither imperial nor metric units are used in the show, meaning it can be shown in any location, regardless of which system is used locally.
In the United States, Team Umizoomi debuted on Nickelodeon on January 25, 2010. On February 20, 2014, it was confirmed that the series would not be renewed for a fifth season, and the live-action roles are not credited. However, reruns continue to air on the Nick Jr. channel and block.
A video game based on the series was released for the Nintendo DS on November 1, 2011.
Overview
