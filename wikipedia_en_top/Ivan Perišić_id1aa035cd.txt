Ivan Perišić
Ivan Perišić (Croatian pronunciation: [ǐʋan pěriʃitɕ]; born 2 February 1989) is a Croatian professional footballer who plays for Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur and the Croatia national team. Usually deployed as a winger, he has also featured as an attacking midfielder, second striker, or wing-back. Known for his ambidexterity and versatility, he is considered to be one of the best wingers of his generation.


A product of the Hajduk Split and Sochaux youth academies, Perišić made a name for himself while playing for Club Brugge, where he was the Belgian Pro League top goalscorer and was named Belgian Footballer of the Year for 2011. This earned him a transfer to Borussia Dortmund, with whom he won the 2011–12 Bundesliga, before signing with VfL Wolfsburg for €8 million in January 2013. He remained there for two and a half seasons, winning the 2015 DFB-Pokal Final, before moving to Inter Milan for €16 million. In 2019, he joined Bayern Munich on loan, winning the treble. After returning to Inter Milan, he won the 2020–21 Serie A and the 2021 Supercoppa Italiana.
Perišić made his debut for the Croatia national team in 2011, and represented his nation at Euro 2012, 2016 and 2020, as well as the 2014, 2018 and 2022 World Cup, reaching the final of the 2018 tournament. Instrumental to Croatia's second "golden generation", Perišić is the nation's player with most goal contributions at the major tournaments (18).
Club career
Early career
Perišić played in the youth ranks of the club he grew up supporting, Hajduk Split. He received interest from a number of clubs, including Anderlecht, PSV, Ajax, Hertha BSC and Hamburger SV. The only match he played for Hajduk was a friendly 3–1 win over Smederevo in Murska Sobota on 16 July 2006. Returning from Murska Sobota to Split, Perišić received offers from Anderlecht and Sochaux. Hajduk offered Perišić a €100,000 contract, which was only €20,000 less than Hajduk's best player Niko Kranjčar's contract. However, the Perišić family opted for French club Sochaux, which paid €360,000 to sign him in the summer of 2006. Sochaux's coach Alain Perrin personally arrived to Split with a private jet to convince Perišić to sign, waiting two days for his signature. His physical and technical attributes led to comparisons to former Croatia international Aljoša Asanović by some journalists. He was a member of the Sochaux youth team, which won the Coupe Gambardella in 2007. During his time at Sochaux, he failed to make a first-team appearance, but did play for the B team. In January 2009, Perišić was sent on loan to Belgian top flight club Roeselare for six months. At the end of the 2008–09 season, there were reports Perišić sought to join Belgian side Anderlecht.
Club Brugge
On 26 August 2009, Belgian club Club Brugge acquired Perišić from Sochaux for a €250,000 transfer fee and signed him to a three-year contract. Prior his move, Perišić was linked with a move to German side Hertha BSC, having gone on trial.
In the opening match of the season, Perišić scored his first goal in a 1–1 draw against Genk, then scored his second in two consecutive games and provided assists in a 4–1 win over Westerlo. Overall, Perišić scored 9 goals in 33 league appearances, also making eight appearances in Brugge's Europa League campaign, scoring four goals. At the end of the season, Perišić signed a new three-year contract at Brugge, keeping him until 2015.
Belgian football critics predicted a bright future for Perišić. In the 2010–11 season, he was the top scorer of the Belgian Jupiler Pro League after scoring 22 goals for Club Brugge, also being named Player of the Year in Belgium. During the season, Perišić scored four goals and provided an assist in a 5–0 win against Charleroi on 29 December 2010.

On 23 May 2011, Perišić signed a five-year contract to play for German side Borussia Dortmund after Dortmund paid an estimated €5 million transfer fee to Brugge. He made his debut for the club in their 3–1 home victory over Hamburger SV on 5 August, substituting on for Chris Löwe in the 75th minute. During a Champions League match on 13 September 2011, he scored a late equaliser with a volley from 20 yards against Arsenal after entering as a substitute in the 69th minute. On 14 October, he scored the first goal in a 2–0 win against Werder Bremen, a match in which he was later sent off for a second bookable offence. On 21 April 2012, he scored the important 1–0 goal against Borussia Mönchengladbach and opened the door to the eighth national championship for Dortmund. The game ended 2–0 (the second was scored by Shinji Kagawa).
Perišić began the 2012–13 Bundesliga season scoring a brace in a 3–2 loss against Hamburger SV on 22 September 2012. However, Perišić soon found his first team opportunities limited, having played less in the first team and soon told Croatian channel Nova TV he had received no support from Dortmund manager Jürgen Klopp and accused him of favouring other players. In response, Klopp criticised his actions as childish and Perišić faced a fine due to his comment.
VfL Wolfsburg
On 6 January 2013, it was reported Perišić transferred for €8 million to VfL Wolfsburg. He scored his first goal for Wolfsburg in a friendly match against Standard Liège on 10 January. He made his competitive debut for Wolfsburg against VfB Stuttgart on 19 January 2013. In March, he suffered a left knee injury that sidelined him throughout March and April.

On 7 February, during the match against Hellas Verona, Perišić came on as a 46th-minute substitute to change the fate of the match, providing an assist for Icardi and also scoring for himself to level the result 3–3, rescuing a point for his side.

On 2 March, in the returning leg of Coppa Italia's semi-final against Juventus at San Siro, Perišić scored the team's second goal of the match to help Inter overturn the 3–0 defeat and equal the aggregate 3–3, which led the match into the penalty shoot-outs.

On 8 January 2017, Inter Milan's first match of the calendar year, Perišić provided a Man of the Match performance by scoring both goals in a 2–1 away win at Udinese; it was his first Inter brace which took his tally up to six goals. This was followed by another splendid individual performance against Chievo six days later as he scored his team's second goal after an individual effort in an eventual 3–1 win.
On 5 February, in the matchday 23 against Juventus at Juventus Stadium, Perišić received his first-ever career red card as Inter Milan were defeated 1–0. He was subsequently banned for two matches by Italian Football Federation (FIGC) for aggressive confrontation of the referee. After Inter Milan appealed the suspension, it was reduced to one match. He returned from suspension on 19 February in the 1–0 win at Bologna, and scored his second brace on 5 March in a 5–1 thrashing of Cagliari at Stadio Sant'Elia.
On 22 April, Perišić reached double-figures for the first time with Inter Milan after scoring in a 5–4 away defeat against Fiorentina.

Upon signing, Perišić said, "It's a special day, it's certainly emotional and I'm happy after the stress of this summer. Now, we can look forward and I'm only thinking about Inter.

In January 2019, English club Arsenal attempted to sign Perišić. He agreed to a deal with the club; however, Inter Milan blocked the deal. Teammate Mauro Icardi's agent Wanda Nara spoke out about Perišić's reasons for the departure, speculating that they might be of personal nature. Nara's comments resulted in a fallout between the players, resulting in Icardi being stripped of captaincy and dropped from the team ahead of a Europa League away fixture against Rapid Wien.
Perišić featured in 34 matches in Serie A, only behind Samir Handanović and Matteo Politano, scoring 8 goals; hence being the second top scorer for Inter after Icardi. Following the appointment of Antonio Conte, Perišić struggled to fit into the new manager's system during pre-season.
