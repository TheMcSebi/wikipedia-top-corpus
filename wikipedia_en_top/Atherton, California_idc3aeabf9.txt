Atherton, California
Atherton (/ˈæθərtən/) is an incorporated town in San Mateo County, California, United States. Its population was 7,188 as of 2020.
Atherton is known for its wealth; in 1990 and 2019, Atherton was ranked as having the highest per capita income among U.S. towns with a population between 2,500 and 9,999, and it is regularly ranked as the most expensive ZIP Code in the United States. 
The town has very restrictive zoning, only permitting one single-family home per acre and no sidewalks. This policy that prohibits homes from being on less than an acre attempts to keep the town wealthy and exclusive, resulting in the average home price of over 7.5 million. Additionally, the inhabitants have strongly opposed proposals to permit more housing construction. Due to the passage of SB 9 in 2022, these aforementioned zoning restrictions that limit how many units can be built on a property are nullified.
The locality engaged in multi-year lawsuits delaying the electrification of Caltrain, which serves cities in the San Francisco Peninsula and Silicon Valley.
The city is also 72.9% White (non Hispanic), and is one of the least diverse cities in Silicon Valley.
History
The entire area was originally part of the Rancho de las Pulgas. 
During the 1860s, Atherton was known as Fair Oaks. In 1923, it was decided to rename the town in honor of  Faxon Dean Atherton, a former 19th century landowner on the south peninsula.
Geography
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 5.0 square miles (13 km2), of which, 5.0 square miles (13 km2) of it is land and 0.03 square miles (0.078 km2) of it (0.63%) is water.
Atherton lies two miles (3.2 km) southeast of Redwood City, and 18 miles (29 km) northwest of San Jose. The town is considered to be part of the San Francisco metropolitan area.
The town had a Caltrain station which permanently closed in December 2020.
Local Politics
Atherton is the wealthiest city in the United States. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, "the town’s ascendance stems largely from its single-family zoning, 1-acre-minimum lot sizes, flat land, streamlined permits and changing buyer demographics — which have translated into soaring house sizes and skyrocketing prices." There is no commercial zoning in the town, thus there are no restaurants, shops or grocery stores. There are no sidewalks in Atherton, only road lanes.
In 2022, the town blocked a proposal to build 131 multifamily housing units in the town amid strong criticism by locals. Housing advocates have criticized Atherton as being a NIMBY town. In 2022, California Governor Gavin Newsom singled out Atherton in a speech for its restrictive housing policies.
The town has been involved in lawsuits to block and delay high-speed rail in California. The train station in Atherton was closed down in 2020.
Atherton's current land use goal is "To preserve the Town's character as a scenic, rural, thickly wooded residential area with abundant open space."
In the California State Legislature, Atherton is in the  13th Senate District, represented by Democrat Josh Becker, and in the  24th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Alex Lee. In the United States House of Representatives, Atherton is in California's  18th congressional district, represented by Democrat Zoe Lofgren.
The city is served by the Atherton Public Library of the San Mateo County Libraries, a member of the Peninsula Library System.
Lawsuit against the electrification of Caltrain
Atherton was an early and vocal opponent of electrification of the U.S. commuter railroad Caltrain, which serves cities in the San Francisco Peninsula and Silicon Valley. Residents opposed electrification and the proposed high-speed rail route because the overhead electrical lines would require tree removal and the town could potentially be divided in two by permanently closing the two grade crossings at Fair Oaks Lane and Watkins Avenue.
In February 2015, shortly after the project received environmental clearance from the state, Atherton sued Caltrain, alleging the agency's environmental impact review was inadequate and that its collaboration with the CHSRA should be further vetted. In July 2015, the suit proceeded after Caltrain's request to the Surface Transportation Board to exempt it from California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) guidelines was denied. Atherton reiterated its opposition to electrification on the basis that overhead wires would require removing a significant number of heritage trees, and city representatives asserted that "newer, cleaner, more efficient diesel trains" should supplant plans for "century-old catenary electrical line technology". Atherton mayor Rick De Golia was quoted as saying "Caltrain is locked into an old technology and 20th century thinking". After Caltrain issued infrastructure and rolling stock contracts in July 2016, Atherton representatives did not file a temporary restraining order to halt those contracts, preferring to let the suit proceed to a hearing. In September 2016, Contra Costa County Superior Court Judge Barry Goode sided with Caltrain, ruling that the electrification project did not hinge on the high-speed rail project's success, and was thus independent from the latter.
Atherton sued CHSRA again in December 2016, stating that using bond money intended for high-speed rail for CalMod was a material change in usage and therefore was unconstitutional because such a change would require voter approval first. In response, the California Legislature allowed the funding to be redirected by passing Assembly Bill No. 1889, which had been championed by Assemblymember Kevin Mullin in 2015. Mullin noted "this entire Caltrain corridor is the epicenter of the innovation economy and it's a job creation and economic engine. This electrification project, I would argue, is monumental with regard to dealing with [increased traffic and environmental impacts] effectively and efficiently."
