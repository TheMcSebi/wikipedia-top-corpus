Michael Beasley
Michael Paul Beasley Jr. (born January 9, 1989) is an American professional basketball player, who most recently played for the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). He played college basketball for Kansas State University for one year before declaring for the NBA draft in 2008. Beasley was the 2nd pick in the 2008 NBA Draft and was selected by the Miami Heat. He is regarded as one of the best freshman college basketball players of the 2000s. Though he is ambidextrous, he shoots left-handed.


Early life
Beasley was born in the Prince George's County town of Cheverly, Maryland. Beasley's mother Fatima Smith and his four siblings (two brothers and two sisters) moved from nearby Montgomery County to Frederick in 2005 and lived there for one year.
High school career
While growing up, Beasley played for one of the country's most successful AAU youth teams at the time, the PG Jaguars. Beasley won multiple national championships with this team alongside future fellow blue-chip recruits Kevin Durant (Texas) and Chris Braswell (Charlotte).  Beasley later moved on to play AAU ball for DC Assault's 17 & Under team, playing alongside such players as future KSU teammate Ron Anderson, Nolan Smith (Duke), Chris Wright (Georgetown), Austin Freeman (Georgetown), and Julian Vaughn (Georgetown).
Beasley attended a total of six high schools: Bowie High School in Bowie, Maryland, National Christian Academy in Fort Washington, Maryland (where he averaged 30 points and 10 rebounds per game in his freshman year, 2003–04), The Pendleton School in Bradenton, Florida, Riverdale Baptist School in Upper Marlboro, Maryland (28 points, 13 rebounds and 4 blocks per game as a sophomore, 2004–05), Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson, Virginia (20.1 points, 10.3 rebounds and 4.5 blocks per game as a junior, 2005–06), and Notre Dame Preparatory School in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. As a high school senior, he averaged 28 points, 16 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 steals and 4.5 blocks per game for the 2006–07 season. During his senior season he had single-game highs of 64 points and 31 rebounds.
In 2006, Beasley was a second-team Parade All-American and was also named to the 2006 USA Men's U18 National Team member on June 26, 2006. Beasley averaged team highs of 13.8 ppg. and 8.3 rpg at the 2006 FIBA Americas U18 Championship for Men in San Antonio, Texas. He ranked fifth in rebounds per game (8.3 rpg) among all 2006 tournament leaders, and he ranks third all-time in the USA Men's U18 record book. He was named to the McDonald's All-American team. In the 2007 McDonald's All-American Boys Game, he won the MVP with 23 points and 12 rebounds. Rivals.com rated Beasley No. 1 in the class of 2007 high school basketball prospects.
College career
Beasley began his freshman year at Kansas State in the fall of 2007.  In the 2007–2008 regular season, Beasley was one of the most dominant players in the country. His 26.2 points (3rd in the nation) and nation-leading 12.4 rebounds were the most by a Big 12 player in any season. His 866 total points and 408 rebounds ranked third and second among all freshmen in NCAA history. He also led the nation in double-doubles (28), 40-point games (three), 30-point, 10-rebound games (13), and 20-point, 10-rebound games (22). His 28 double-doubles broke the freshman double-double record previously held by Carmelo Anthony who had 22 double-doubles in his only season at Syracuse in 2002–03. On February 23, 2008, Beasley scored a Big 12 record 44 points in a 92–86 loss at Baylor. (This mark has since been matched by Kansas State's Denis Clemente.) Beasley became known as an unstoppable force when shooting, finishing the season shooting 53.7 percent from the field (282 of 525). He also finished the season shooting 39.5 percent from 3-point range.
Beasley holds 30 Kansas State career, single-season and freshman records as well as 17 Big 12 single-game and single-season marks. Beasley guided the Wildcats to a 20–10 record and a 10–6 Big 12 Conference record.  Some of the key conference victories were a win at Oklahoma and, a home victory against Texas A&M, and a victory against then-unbeaten No. 2 Kansas, marking the first time in over four years that Kansas State defeated a Top 10 team at home (Kansas State beat No. 10 Texas, 58–48 on March 6, 2004), the first time K-State beat Kansas in Manhattan since 1983 and the first-ever victory against the Jayhawks in Bramlage Coliseum. The win partially backed up a boast he had made before the season about K-State's prospects against the Jayhawks:
On March 1, 2008, his boast did not come true, as Kansas won the return match in Lawrence, 88–74 despite 39 points and 11 rebounds from Beasley. He matched a Big 12 record by equaling former Kansas player Drew Gooden's record for most double-doubles in a season (25). With his 33-point, 14-rebound effort against Colorado on March 4, he eclipsed Mitch Richmond's 20-year-old school single-season points record (768; 1987–88), while he broke the Big 12 record for double-doubles in a season with his 26th for the year. He is just the 27th player in NCAA Division I history to post 26 or more double-doubles in a season and the first since Utah's Andrew Bogut (26) did it in 2004–05.
Beasley led the Wildcats to a 10–6 record in conference play, earning a number 3 seed in the 2008 Big 12 men's basketball tournament at the Sprint Center in Kansas City, Missouri. The Wildcats faced the No. 6 seed Texas A&M Aggies and lost 77–71. Beasley had 25 points and 9 rebounds, one board short of a double-double. He shot 10–21 from the field and 1–4 from behind the three-point line. He also registered three blocks. The Wildcats earned a berth in the 2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament as the No. 11 seed in the Midwest Region.  They beat the No. 6 seed USC Trojans. Beasley had 23 points and 11 rebounds for his 27th double-double of the year. However, the Wildcats lost 72–55 to No. 3 Wisconsin in the second round of the tournament. Beasley added 23 points (only 6 scored in the second half) and 13 rebounds against the Badgers his 28th and final double-double.
On April 14, 2008, Beasley announced that he would forgo his last three years of eligibility and enter the NBA draft.
Awards and honors
Beasley is one of just two players in Kansas State history to earn first team All-America honors from the Associated Press. Overall, Beasley is the fifth player in school history to earn recognition to any of organization's three All-America teams. Beasley was one of 24 finalists for the John R. Wooden Player of the Year award and was selected by voters to the 10-member 2008 John R. Wooden Award All American team. He followed Kevin Durant as the second consecutive standout freshman to win both Big 12 Player of the Year and Freshman of the Year accolades.
Beasley became the fourth player in school history to be honored as the conference's Player of the Year and the first since the inception of the Big 12.  He was the first player to be named league Freshman of the Year and the 12th overall to be selected as either Freshman or Newcomer of the Year since 1970.
Beasley was named National Freshman of the Year by CBS Sports.com, Rivals.com, The Sporting News, and the U.S. Basketball Writers Association (USBWA). He has also been selected a first team All-American by numerous outlets, including CBS Sports.com, Dick Vitale, ESPN.com, Rivals.com, Sports Illustrated, The Sporting News and U.S. Basketball Writers Association.

On September 3, 2013, Beasley was waived by the Suns. The decision came shortly after Beasley had been arrested on suspicion of marijuana possession. Lon Babby, the Suns' president of basketball operations, said, "We worked hard to devote ourselves to Michael's success, but we have to maintain the standards to build a championship culture."
Return to Miami (2013–2014)
On September 11, 2013, Beasley signed with the Miami Heat. The Heat made it to the NBA Finals for the fourth straight time in 2014, with Beasley making his first Finals appearance in Game 5 of their series against the San Antonio Spurs. The Heat lost Game 5 and the series, as the Spurs won 4–1.

Legal issues
On September 3, 2008, at the NBA's Rookie Transition Program, Beasley was involved in an incident along with fellow rookies Mario Chalmers and Darrell Arthur. Police responded to the hotel room of Chalmers and Arthur following a fire alarm at 2 am and claimed that the room smelled strongly of burning marijuana, but none was found and no charges were filed. Chalmers and Arthur were excused from the camp because of the incident and were later fined $20,000 each for missing the rookie camp, but were not fined or suspended for any drug-related violations. Both later denied any involvement with marijuana. Originally, ESPN reported that Beasley was also present in the room, but was not asked to leave camp. The story was later updated and any mention of Beasley was removed from the article.
On September 18, 2008, Beasley was fined $50,000 by the league for his involvement in the incident after he confessed to league officials that he had slipped out the door when the police arrived.
On August 24, 2009, Beasley reportedly checked into a Houston rehab center, just days after he posted pictures of himself on Twitter with what some have speculated to be marijuana in the background. It is unknown if the rehab was drug related; officially he was receiving counseling for stress-related issues.
On June 26, 2011, Beasley was driving in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka when he was pulled over by a policeman for speeding. The policeman noticed that the car smelled of a strong odor of marijuana. The officer allegedly found marijuana in a plastic bag under the front passenger seat. However, Beasley said the marijuana was not his, but belonged to a friend whom he had just dropped off. Beasley was consequently fined and ticketed.
In August 2011, Beasley was on a streetball tour in New York City with All-Star forward Kevin Durant when he got into an altercation with a heckler, shoving a hand in the heckler's face.
On August 6, 2013, Beasley was arrested on suspicion of marijuana possession in Scottsdale, Arizona. According to police reports, narcotics were confiscated from Beasley's car after he was stopped for a traffic violation. That arrest was a factor in Beasley's official removal from the Suns a month later.
In September 2014, a sexual assault case from January 2013 involving Beasley was dropped after no probable cause was established.
On August 8, 2019, he was suspended five games for violating the NBA’s anti-drug policy.
